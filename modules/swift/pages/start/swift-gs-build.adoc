== Starter Code

Open *ViewController.swift* in Xcode and copy the following code in the `viewDidLoad` method.
This snippet demonstrates how to run basic CRUD operations, a simple Query and running bi-directional replications with Sync Gateway.

In the next step, you will setup Sync Gateway.
Before synchronizing documents to Sync Gateway you will need to disable App Transport Security (ATS) on iOS.
App Transport Security is enabled by default since iOS 9 and enforces applications to use HTTPS exclusively.
For this getting started guide, you will disable it but we recommend to enable it in production (and xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#connection-to-sync-gateway[enable HTTPS on Sync Gateway]).
In the Xcode navigator, right-click on *Info.plist* and open it as a source file.

Append the following inside of the `<dict>` XML tags to disable ATS.

[source,xml]
----
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/>
</dict>
