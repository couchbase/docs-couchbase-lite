== Overview

A `Blob` is an object that can appear in a document as a property value.
Just instantiate a `Blob` and set it as the value of a property.
Then later get the property value, which will be a `Blob` object.

The following code example adds a blob to the document under the `avatar` property.

The `Blob` API lets you access the contents as in-memory data (a `Data` object) or as a `InputStream`.
It also supports an optional `type` property that by convention stores the MIME type of the contents.

In the example above, "image/jpeg" is the MIME type and "avatar" is the key which references that `Blob`.
That key can be used to retrieve the `Blob` object at a later time.

On Couchbase Lite, blobs can be arbitrarily large, and are only read on demand, not when you load a `Document` object.
On Sync Gateway, the maximum content size is 20 MB per blob.
If a document's blob is over 20 MB, the document will be replicated but not the blob.

When a document is synchronized, the Couchbase Lite replicator will add an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains a blob.
A random access name will be generated for each `Blob` which is different to the "avatar" key that was used in the example above.
On the image below, the document now contains the `_attachments` dictionary when viewed in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.

//image::ROOT::assets/images/attach-replicated.png[,500]
//image::attach-replicated.png[,500]
image::ROOT:attach-replicated.png[,500]

A blob also has properties such as `"digest"` (a SHA-1 digest of the data), `"length"` (the length in bytes), and optionally `"content_type"` (the MIME type).
The data is not stored in the document, but in a separate content-addressable store, indexed by the digest.

This `Blob` can be retrieved on the Sync Gateway REST API at \http://localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1.
Notice that the blob identifier in the URL path is "blob_1" (not "avatar").
