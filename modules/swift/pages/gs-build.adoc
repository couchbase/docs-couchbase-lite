NOTE: You may encounter a `Target Integrity Error` when building for iOS Simulator(or iOS) -- see xref:{gs-prereqs--page}#lbl-tgtinterr[Dealing with Target Integrity Error]

== Quick Steps

. Create a new Swift project as outlined in xref:{param-module}:gs-install.adoc[Install]
. Open the new project's *ViewController.swift* module in Xcode
. Replace the boiler-plate code with the code shown in <<ex-starter-code>>
. Build and run the 'app' +
You should see -- <<img-starter-code>> -- the document ID and property printed to the 'console log', indicating that a document was created successfully persisted to the database, updated and queried.

// In the next step, you will setup Sync Gateway.
// Before synchronizing documents to Sync Gateway you will need to disable App Transport Security (ATS) on iOS.
// App Transport Security is enabled by default since iOS 9 and enforces applications to use HTTPS exclusively.
// For this getting started guide, you will disable it but we recommend to enable it in production (and xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#connection-to-sync-gateway[enable HTTPS on Sync Gateway]).
// In the Xcode navigator, right-click on *Info.plist* and open it as a source file.

// image::info-plist.png[]

// Append the following inside of the `<dict>` XML tags to disable ATS.

// [source,xml]
// ----
// <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
// <dict>
// <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/>
// </dict>
