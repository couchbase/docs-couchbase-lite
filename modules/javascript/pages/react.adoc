NOTE: Couchbase Lite for React Native is a community-driven project without official support from Couchbase.

// == Introduction


// tag::summary[]
To use Couchbase Lite as an embedded database within your React Native app, you need a way to access Couchbase Lite's iOS and Android native APIs from within it.

React Native's _NativeModule_ system provides an answer, exposing instances of native classes to JavaScript (JS) as JS objects.

// end::summary[]


// == Functionality


{docs}[React Native Modules]
allow mobile apps written in React Native to access native platform APIs.
So in order to use Couchbase Lite within your React Native apps, you should implement a React Native plugin that exports the Couchbase Lite Android and iOS APIs to Javascript.
It is typical to start with exporting the minimal subset of APIs that your app needs.
