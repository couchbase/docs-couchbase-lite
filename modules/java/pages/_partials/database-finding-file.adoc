By default a {cblJP} database is created in a directory at the current location called  `<databaseName>.cblite2`.

This location is set by the link:{url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/DatabaseConfiguration.html[DatabaseConfiguration] method.
See the following example  for how to do this:

[source, source-language]
----
DatabaseConfiguration thisConfig = new DatabaseConfiguration(); thisConfig.setDirectory("yourDBpath");
Database thisDB = new Database("db", thisConfig);
----
