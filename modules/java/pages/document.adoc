// == Overview
// In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object -- a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects.
// Every document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
// the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.

// == Initializers

// The following methods/initializers can be used:

// * The `MutableDocument()` initializer can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
// * The `MutableDocument(String id)` initializer can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.
// * The `database.getDocument(String id)` method can be used to get a document.
// If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
// This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.

// The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.

// == Mutability

// When a document is read from the database it is immutable.
// Use the `document.toMutable()` method to create an updateable instance of the document.

// [source]
// ----
// include::{snippet}[tags=update-document,indent=0]
// ----

// Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.

// == Typed Accessors

// The `Document` class now offers a set of {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Dictionary.html[`property accessors`] for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point and strings.
// These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

// In addition, as a convenience we offer `Date` accessors.
// Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.
// The following example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the `document.getDate(String key)` accessor method.

// [source]
// ----
// include::{snippet}[tags=date-getter,indent=0]
// ----

// If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default value for that getter method (0 for `getInt`, 0.0 for `getFloat` etc.).
// To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use the {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Document.html#contains-java.lang.String-[`Document.Contains(String key)`] method.

// == Batch Operations

// If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
// The following example persists a few documents in batch.

// [source]
// ----
// include::{snippet}[tags=batch,indent=0]
// ----

// At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
// But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

// == Document Change Events

// It's also possible to register for document changes.
// The following example registers for changes to the document with ID `user.john` and prints the `verified_account` property.
