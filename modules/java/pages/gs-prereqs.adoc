.Vector Search Prerequisites
[IMPORTANT]
--
Vector Search is only available for 64-bit architectures and
Intel processors that support the Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) instruction set.
Most machines manufactured within the last ten years support this instruction set.
You can check if your machine supports the AVX2 instruction set by following the instructions https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090473/processors/intel-core-processors.html[here.]

== Introduction

{cblJP} enables development and deployment of {cbl} applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy to a desktop or web server (for example, {gpWebServerEnv}), including embedded {gpWebServerEnv} deployments.

NOTE: We use _{gpIDE}_, _{gpBuildTool}_, _Maven_ and _{gpWebServerEnv}_ as tools to build and run the examples presented in this content.
You are free to use the tools of your choice.


[#bmkSetupSyncAndServer, Setting up Sync Gateway]

== Install Server Software

If you want to use {cbljp} with {svr} and-or {sg} you will need to have installed operational instances of these before completing the installation and test build steps.

So, If you have not already done so, see {sgw-prepare--xref}

* Within {svr}, create a bucket named {nmSampleAppDb}
* Create a RBAC user for {sg} with username = `sync-gateway` and password = `password`


== MacOS and Windows

You may now proceed directly to xref:gs-install.adoc[].

[#additional-steps-for-linux]
== Additional Steps For Linux

Before proceeding to xref:gs-install.adoc[], you will need to make the supplied support libraries available to your running application.

=== Steps

. Download the _zip_ file from here -- https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-lite-java/{version-maintenance-java}/couchbase-lite-java-linux-supportlibs-{version-maintenance-java}.zip
.
. Unpack the downloaded file to a location accessible to your build and runtime environments, for example `your_dir/couchbase-lite-java-{version-maintenance-java}`.

[#bmkLinuxSharedLibs]
. Set up the Native Libraries for Linux.
You will need to add the path of the directory `<lib-directory>` to the value of the Java system property `java.library.path`.

Normally, the simplest way to set this is through the shell variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

[{tabs}]
====
Web Service/Tomcat::
+
--
Add the variables to your `$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh`.
(If the setenv.sh file doesn't exist, you will need to create a new file.)

[source, bashrc, subs="attributes"]
----
{ld-library-path}
----
--

Desktop::
+
--
Export the variable in your .bashrc file:

[source, bashrc, subs="attributes"]
----
export {ld-library-path}

Please refer to the Linux Platform Support section for the minimum version requirements of those libraries.
