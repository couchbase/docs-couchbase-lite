== Introduction

{cblJP} enables development and deployment of {cbl} applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy to a desktop or web server (for example, {gpWebServerEnv}), including embedded {gpWebServerEnv} deployments.

NOTE: We use _{gpIDE}_, _{gpBuildTool}_, _Maven_ and _{gpWebServerEnv}_ as tools to build and run the examples presented in this content.
You are free to use the tools of your choice.

== Install Companion Software

If you want to use {cbljp} with {svr} and-or {sg} you will need to have installed operational instances of these before completing the installation and test build steps.

So, If you have not already done so, see {sgw-prepare--xref}

* Within {svr}, create a bucket named {nmSampleAppDb}
* Create a RBAC user for {sg} with username = `sync-gateway` and password = `password`

== Downloaded Binaries

===  Package Contents

The download package contains a license file, jar libraries for the appropriate edition of the {cbl} and a set of Linux _shared libraries_.

Get the download package from here -- {downloads-mobile--xref}.

* Community Edition -- {packageNmCE}
* Enterprise Edition -- {packageNmEE}

When unpacked the package contains the following:

* A `lib` folder containing all necessary JAR files:
** {packageNmCE} or for EE {packageNmEE}
** okhttp-3.14.7.jar
** okio-1.17.2.jar

* A `support` folder containing the Linux native libraries:
+
NOTE: This means you do not need to download and-or build compatible versions of system libraries for the Linux platform of choice.

** `libz` (requires zlib v.1.2.11+)
** `lib{cpp}` requires libc++ v.3.6.0+)
** `libicu` (requires ICU4C v.5.4.1+)

// Go back to <<GET STARTED>>

=== Steps

. Download the _zip_ file from here -- {downloads-mobile--xref}.
. Unpack the downloaded file to a location accessible to -- and usable by -- your chosen *build* environment.
+
We'll refer to that location -- `<your dir>/{packageNmCE}` -- as the `<pathToCbl>`.

. Include the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file, you can remove any {cbl} Maven references:
+
----
Dependencies {
  implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: <pathToCbl>/lib>
}
----

Where <pathToCbl> is the location of the downloaded {cbl} library.
