== GET STARTED

Couchbase Lite on Java enables development and deployment of Couchbase Lite applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy to a desktop or web server (for example, {gpWebServerEnv}), including embedded {gpWebServerEnv} deployments.

Use this page to familiarize yourself with the product, its components, deployment, and use.

You will learn:

* Where to get the necessary binaries -- <<Where to Get Binaries>>
* What the binaries contain -- <<Using Downloaded Binaries>>
* How to deploy {cblJP} -- <<Preparing Your Build Environment>>
* How to use {cblJP} to create a simple application -- {xref-cbl-pg-build}

NOTE: We use _{gpIDE}_, _{gpBuildTool}_, _Maven_ and _{gpWebServerEnv}_ as tools to build and run the examples presented in this content.
You are free to use the tools of your choice.

== Where to Get Binaries
{cblJP} binaries are available for both Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) editions from the _Maven_ repositories -- see: <<Preparing Your Build Environment>> for how.

Alternatively, you can download a version in `.zip` format -- see: <<Using Downloaded Binaries>> for how.

== Preparing Your Build Environment

=== Prerequisites

* Planning to sync with a {svr}?
+
You will need to have runnable instances of {svr} and {sg} installed.
If you have not already done so see <<Preparatory Steps>>
* Running on Microsoft Windows?
+
Windows requires {Cpp} runtime installed.
Please install the Visual {Cpp} Redistribution package from this link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685
* Running on Linux?
+
You must have loaded the shared libraries as described in <<Additional Steps for Linux>>

=== Assumptions

This section shows how to set up and use {cblJP} to build desktop and web applications using {gpBuildTool}, Maven, {gpWebServerEnv} and {gpIDE} Community Edition.

It assumes a familiarity with these products, however you are free to use your own choice of development tools.

The contents of your `build.gradle` file will depend on the type of project you are building, whether you are using Community or Enterprise edition and whether you prefer to use Maven-distributed binaries or a zip download.

TIP: If you wish to use a downloaded zip instead of Maven then see - <<Using Downloaded Binaries>>

NOTE: If you are deploying to Linux, you will need the {cbl} `support` library, which is available _only_ on the zip download distributable -- see <<Additional Steps for Linux>>

Web App Development::
+
--

This section explains how to set-up a build project to create {cblJP} web apps using {gpBuildTool} and {gpIDE}.

*The WebApp Build Environment*

In our examples here we build and deploy web apps using a {gpBuildTool} plugin based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin. It provides a simple {gpWebServerEnv} harness that can be used from within {gpIDEce} or the command-line.

Of course if you are using {gpIDEee} you can use its integrated tomcat features to achieve the same results.

For more about this plugin and its use see <<Using the Gradle WebApp Plugin>>

anchor:bmkMultCblJapps[Running multiple {cblJP} web apps]
*Running multiple {cblJP} web apps*
Each web application has its own *class loader (WebappX). This loads the classes, jars, and resources found in the application's `WEB-INF/classes` and `WEB-INF/lib` folders, together with any shared jar files from `$CATALINA_BASE/lib` -- see link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html[tomcat documentation] for more.

So, if you are running multiple {cbl} web applications, deploy your {cbljp} library `<pathToCbl>/libs` to `$CATALINA_BASE/lib`. This means you do not need to deploy it in each web app and *minimizes the size of each app*.

NOTE:  Configuring {cbl} logging functionality will affect the logging of all web applications as the _common class loader_ shares _{cbl} Console, File_ and _Custom logging functionalities_  across all  web apps.

For information about building a WAR file see <<Deploying a WAR file to tomcat>>

*Prerequisites*

* Ensure your build environment matches the runtime {gpWebServerEnv} environment. Specifically, that the Java and  {gpWebServerEnv} versions are the same.
* If your {gpWebServerEnv} server runs Linux, declare the _shared libraries_ (`<pathToCbl>/support` --  as discussed in <<bmkLinuxSharedLibs>>) in the `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh` script file.
* Ensure the {cbl} jars (`<pathToCbl>/lib`) are on the executable path within {gpWebServerEnv} -- see: <<bmkMultCblJapps>>
+

TIP: This also means you should declare the dependencies as `providedCompile` to avoid them being bundled into the `WEB-INF/libs` folder

*Steps*

. Create a project folder and initialize it for a Gradle Java application
+
[source, bashrc]
----
gradle init
----

. Create your `build.gradle` file, including the following repositories and dependencies:

* For Community edition
+
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
include::partial$gsBuildGradleJava.adoc[tag=dependenciesCE]
----

* For Enterprise Edition
+
[source,groovy]

----
include::partial$gsBuildGradleJava.adoc[tag=repositories]
include::partial$gsBuildGradleJava.adoc[tag=dependencies]
----

. Open the project folder in {gpIDE} and import the {gpBuildTool} settings.

+
TIP: If you don't have auto-import set for Gradle projects, then accept the   *Import Gradle Project* prompt that is displayed bottom-right of the screen

+
Note the Gradle menu at the extreme right of the screen:
+

image::GradleMenuWebApp.png[,300]

If you want to deploy your app to a local tomcat container then see <<Deploying a WAR file to tomcat>>


That's it. You're all set to start building your own {cblJP} applications -- see <<Building a Getting Started App>> for an example of how to do that.

== SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

=== Preparatory Steps

anchor:bmkSetupSyncAndServer[Setting up Sync Gateway]

*Install {svr} and {sg}*

Before you can run any {cbljp} app you will need to have runnable instances of {svr} and {sg}.
If you have not already done so:


Install _{svr}_ and _{sg}_ -- see {xref-sgw-pg-install}

*Create the Getting Started App Database*

[{orderedList}]
. Within {svr}, create a bucket named {nmSampleAppDb}
+
For instructions -- see {xref-sgw-pg-svr-cfg-bmk-createbucket}
+
[{steps}]
. Create a RBAC user for {sg}
+
For instructions -- see {xref-sgw-pg-svr-cfg-bmk-createuser}
[{steps2}]
** Set username to `sync-gateway`
** Set password to `password`

Back to <<Preparing Your Build Environment>>

=== Using Downloaded Binaries

*Package Contents*

The download package contains a license file, jar libraries for the appropriate edition of the {cbl} and a set of Linux _shared libraries_.

Get the download package from the link:{url-cb-downloads-mobile}[{nmCBdwnlds}] page.

* Community Edition -- {packageNmCE}
* Enterprise Edition -- {packageNmEE}

When unpacked the package contains the following:

* A `lib` folder containing all necessary JAR files:
** {packageNmCE} or for EE {packageNmEE}
** okhttp-3.14.7.jar
** okio-1.17.2.jar

* A `support` folder containing the Linux native libraries:
+
NOTE: This means you do not need to download and-or build compatible versions of system libraries for the Linux platform of choice.

** `libz` (requires zlib v.1.2.11+)
** `lib{cpp}` requires libc++ v.3.6.0+)
** `libicu` (requires ICU4C v.5.4.1+)

Go back to <<GET STARTED>>

*Steps*

. Download the _zip_ file from the link:{url-cb-downloads-mobile}[{nmCBdwnlds}] page.
. Unpack the downloaded file to a location accessible to -- and usable by -- your chosen *build* environment.
+
We'll refer to that location -- `<your dir>/{packageNmCE}` -- as the `<pathToCbl>`.

. Include the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file, you can remove any {cbl} Maven references:
+
----
Dependencies {
  implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: <pathToCbl>/lib>
}
----

Where <pathToCbl> is the location of the downloaded {cbl} library.

=== Using the Gradle WebApp Plugin

The simplest way to build and deploy your {cblJP} web app is to use a {gpBuildTool} plugin that provides a simple {gpWebServerEnv} harness.

Our examples are based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin -- see https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin[com.bmuschko.tomcat on Github].

Including the plugin in your `build.gradle` file make a number of tomcat tasks available to you. View them using:

[source, bashrc]

----
./gradlew tasks
----

This shows that the following web application tasks are now available:

** `tomcatJasper` - Runs the JSP compiler and turns JSP pages into Java source.
** `tomcatRun` - Uses your files as and where they are and deploys them to Tomcat.
** `tomcatRunWar` - Assembles the web app into a war and deploys it to Tomcat.
** `tomcatStop` - Stops Tomcat.

So, to run the app use:

----
tomcatRun
----

Back to <<Preparing Your Build Environment>>

=== Deploying a WAR file to tomcat

If you want to deploy your web app to a local Tomcat instance then you will need to generate a WAR file.
However, you should note that when creating a war file, if you use the `implementation` dependency type then your _Couchbase Lite_ jar files will be bundled into WEB-INF/lib of the web application.
To exclude Couchbase Lite jar files from getting bundled and to use Couchbase Lite in multiple web applications, change the dependency type from *`implementation`* to *`providedCompile`*

. You can do this using the Gradle command below from within your project folder:
[source, bashrc]
+
----
./gradlew war
----
+
NOTE:  The generated war file will be at <PROJECT ROOT>/build/libs.


. Deploy the war file to Tomcat, by copying it to $CATALINA_BASE/webapps
+
TIP: You can also use Tomcat’s Manager App to deploy the war file -- see link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html[tomcat's Manager App] documentation for more detail.

. To use common class loader approach to load Couchbase Lite libraries, copy all of the Couchbase Lite jar files in $CATALINA_BASE/lib.
