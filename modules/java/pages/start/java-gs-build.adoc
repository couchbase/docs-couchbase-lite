== Build a Getting Started App

This section explains how to validate your configured build environment by building a starter app that uses many of {cblJP}'s more common features.

// TIP: The {nmMobStarterApp} app can be downloaded from GitHub link:{url-cb-mobStarterApp}[{nmMobStarterApp}].

The {nmMobStarterApp} app demonstrates how to use {cblJP}. Console and Web App versions are available.

====

Console App::
+
--

TIP: Ensure you added the {cbl} dependency to your `build.gradle` file

Create, build and run a new project using the following `GettingStarted.java` code:



[source,java]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=getting-started,indent=0]
----
<1> The app will start a replicator pointing to `ws://localhost:4984/db`, where `db` is the name of your {sg} database
<2> This is the only API that differs from the {android} version. It accepts no parameters and should be called once only
<3> You can optionally AES-256 encrypt the database by providing a key
<4> This is needed for a tidy closedown of work executors
<5> It is advisable to set a specific directory path for the database.

On running the app, you should see the document ID and property printed to the console together with a query result showing the number of rows in the database.

This shows the document was successfully persisted to the database.

See <<About the Getting Started App>> for more on the app itself

Web App::
+
--

This section explains how to set-up a build project to create {cblJP} web apps using {gpBuildTool} and {gpIDE}.

*Steps*

. Create a new project folder and add a `build.gradle` file containing the following:
+
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsEmbeddedTomcatBuildGradle,indent=0]
----

. Within {gpIDE}, open the new project folder
+
If you don't have auto-import enabled, then accept the *Import from Gradle* prompt that appears at the bottom right of the screen.
. Create a Java class _GettingStarted_ using this code:
+
[source, java]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsWebApp_GettingStarted,indent=0]
----
+
<1> It is advisable to set a specific directory path for the database.
<2> The app will start a replicator pointing to `ws://localhost:4984/db`, where `db` is the name of your {sg} database
+
. Create a Java class _Listener_ using this code:
+
[source, java]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsWebApp_Listener,indent=0]
----
+

. Create a Java class _Database Manager_ using this code:
+
[source, java]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsWebApp_DbManager,indent=0]
----
+
<1> This is the only API that differs from the {android} version. It accepts no parameters and should be called once only
<2> It is advisable to set a specific directory path for the database.
<3> You can optionally AES-256 encrypt the database by providing a key
+
. Create an `index.html` file in `src/main/web app` with the following content:
+
[source, html]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsWebApp_Index,indent=0]
----

. Create a `showDbItems.jsp` file in `src/main/web app` with the following content:
+
[source, html]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=GsWebApp_ShowDbItems,indent=0]
----

. Build, deploy and run the app using `tomcatRun`
+
image::GradleMenuWebApp.png[,300]

.. Point your browser to: `localhost:8080/gettingstarted`
+
This opens the browser at your index.html page.
..  Select the *here* link
+
This launches the servlet and displays the results in `showdDbItems.jsp`.
They are also added to the _catalina.out_ log file.

About the Starter App::
+
--

anchor:bmkAboutGettingStarted[]
The {nmMobStarterApp} app will:

* Create a database
+
The app creates its database in the `{nmSampleAppDbPath}` directory relative to its root location when run (See: {xref-cbl-pg-database-bmk-findfile}).

TIP: Explicitly state your required database location when creating your database (see: {xref-cbl-pg-database-bmk-findfile} for how to do this)

* Add content to the DB
* Run a simple query counting the DB rows
* Start a one-shot, bi-directional replication using {sg} and {svr}
* Produce a simple report on the db Contents
+
image::java:cblOutput.png[,400]

NOTE: Before starting your app ensure you have started both your {svr} and {sg} instances.
