== Introduction

{cblJP} enables development and deployment of {cbl} applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy to a desktop or web server (for example, {gpWebServerEnv}), including embedded {gpWebServerEnv} deployments.

NOTE: We use _{gpIDE}_, _{gpBuildTool}_, _Maven_ and _{gpWebServerEnv}_ as tools to build and run the examples presented in this content.
You are free to use the tools of your choice.

== Preparatory Steps for Installation and Use

anchor:bmkSetupSyncAndServer[Setting up Sync Gateway]

=== Install Companion Software
If you want to use {cbljp} with {svr} and-or {sg} you will need to have installed operational instances of these before completing the installation and test build steps.

So, If you have not already done so:

Install _{svr}_ and _{sg}_ for instructions -- see {xref-sgw-pg-install}

For supported versions -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-compatibility} | {xref-cbl-pg-supported-os}

=== Prepare {svr} and {sg} for the Test Build

[{orderedList}]
. Within {svr}, create a bucket named {nmSampleAppDb}
+
For instructions -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-svr-cfg-bmk-createbucket}
+
[{steps}]
. Create a RBAC user for {sg}
+
For instructions -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-svr-cfg-bmk-createuser}
[{steps2}]
** Set username to `sync-gateway`
** Set password to `password`

== How to Use Downloaded Binaries

*Package Contents*

The download package contains a license file, jar libraries for the appropriate edition of the {cbl} and a set of Linux _shared libraries_.

Get the download package from the link:{url-cb-downloads-mobile}[{nmCBdwnlds}] page.

* Community Edition -- {packageNmCE}
* Enterprise Edition -- {packageNmEE}

When unpacked the package contains the following:

* A `lib` folder containing all necessary JAR files:
** {packageNmCE} or for EE {packageNmEE}
** okhttp-3.14.7.jar
** okio-1.17.2.jar

* A `support` folder containing the Linux native libraries:
+
NOTE: This means you do not need to download and-or build compatible versions of system libraries for the Linux platform of choice.

** `libz` (requires zlib v.1.2.11+)
** `lib{cpp}` requires libc++ v.3.6.0+)
** `libicu` (requires ICU4C v.5.4.1+)

// Go back to <<GET STARTED>>

*Steps*

. Download the _zip_ file from the link:{url-cb-downloads-mobile}[{nmCBdwnlds}] page.
. Unpack the downloaded file to a location accessible to -- and usable by -- your chosen *build* environment.
+
We'll refer to that location -- `<your dir>/{packageNmCE}` -- as the `<pathToCbl>`.

. Include the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file, you can remove any {cbl} Maven references:
+
----
Dependencies {
  implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: <pathToCbl>/lib>
}
----

Where <pathToCbl> is the location of the downloaded {cbl} library.
