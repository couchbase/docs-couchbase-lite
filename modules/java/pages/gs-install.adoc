== Introduction


{cbl-te} on Java {version-full}_ enables development and deployment of {cbl} applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy Standalone (Java Desktop/Console) apps or Web Apps (using, for example, Tomcat; including embedded Tomcat deployments).


.Quick Steps
****
For experienced developers, this is all you need to add _{cbl} for {param-title} {version-full}_ to your application projects.

[{tabs}]
=====
Enterprise Edition::
+
--
Include the following in your Gradle `build.gradle` or Maven `pom.xml` file, as appropriate:

* The Couchbase Enterprise Edition repository +
`https://mobile.maven.couchbase.com/maven2/dev/`

* The {cbl} Enterprise Edition dependency: +
`couchbase-lite-java-ee:{version-full}`
--

Community Edition::
+
--
. Include the {cbl} for Java dependency in your Gradle `build.gradle` or Maven `pom.xml` file, as appropriate: +
`couchbase-lite-java:{version-full}`
. For Gradle: +
Check you have `mavenCentral()` in `repositories` (or in `settings.gradle`). +
Maven automatically checks its own repo for dependencies.
--
=====
****
That's it!
You're all set to begin developing powerful {cbl} applications.

Now, try the xref:gs-build.adoc[Getting Started] application, which demonstrates use of key CRUD functionality.



== Preparing Your Build Environment


This section shows how to set up and use {cbl} on {JP} to build desktop and web applications using gradle, Maven, Tomcat and Intellij IDEA Community Edition.
It assumes a familiarity with these products, however you are free to use your own choice of development tools.

=== Binaries

{cbl} on {JP} binaries are available for both Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) editions from the _Maven_ repositories.
Alternatively, you can download compressed binaries -- see the _Downloaded Binaries_ section in {cbl--xref} gs-prereqs.adoc[Prerequisites]

=== Prerequisites

* Planning to sync with a pass:q,a[_Couchbase{nbsp}Server_]?
+
You will need to have runnable instances of pass:q,a[_Couchbase{nbsp}Server_] and pass:q,a[{sgw-te}] installed.
If you have not already done so see {sgw--xref}get-started-prepare.adoc[Prepare Sync Gateway]
* Running on Microsoft Windows?
+
Windows requires {Cpp} runtime installed.
Please install the Visual {Cpp} Redistribution package from this link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685

* Deploying to Linux? +
You need to deploy the {cbl} `support` library, which is available _only_ on the zip download distributable.
See the _Additional Steps for Linux_ section in {cbl--xref} gs-prereqs.adoc[Prerequisites].


== Standalone Apps


=== Using Gradle

. Create a project folder
. Initialize it for a Gradle Java application
. Include the content shown in <<ex-bgf1>> in your app-level `build.gradle` file
. Open the project folder in Intellij IDEA and import the gradle settings.
+
--
TIP: If you don't have auto-import set for Gradle projects, then accept the *Import Gradle Project* prompt that is displayed bottom-right of the screen +
Note the Gradle menu at the extreme right of the screen:

--

That's it.
You're all set to start building your own {cbl} on {JP} applications -- see {cbl--xref} gs-build.adoc[Build and Run] for an example of how to do that.

== Web App Development


This section explains how to set-up a build project to create {cbl} on {JP} web apps using gradle and Intellij IDEA.

.Using Maven
[TIP]
--
For examples of how to do this using Maven POM files, see --

* https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/tree/master/java/TravelSample[Couchbase Mobile Workshop]

* https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-training-todo/tree/release/lithium/java-ws/server/Todo[Mobile Taining To Do App]
--


=== Tomcat

In our examples here we build and deploy web apps using a gradle plugin based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin.
It provides a simple Tomcat harness that can be used from within Intellij IDEA or the command-line -- see <<lbl-tomcat>>

[#bmkMultCblJapps, Running multiple {cbl} on {JP} web apps]
=== Multiple Web Apps

Each web application has its own *class loader (WebappX).
This loads the classes, jars, and resources found in the application's `WEB-INF/classes` and `WEB-INF/lib` folders, together with any shared jar files from `$CATALINA_BASE/lib` -- see https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html[tomcat documentation] for more.

So, if you are running multiple {cbl} web applications, deploy your {cbljp} library `<pathToCbl>/libs` to `$CATALINA_BASE/lib`. This means you do not need to deploy it in each web app and *minimizes the size of each app*.

NOTE:  Configuring {cbl} logging functionality will affect the logging of all web applications as the _common class loader_ shares _{cbl} Console, File_ and _Custom logging functionalities_  across all  web apps.

For information about building a WAR file see <<lbl-war>>

=== Prerequisites

* Ensure your build environment matches the runtime Tomcat environment.
Specifically, that the Java and Tomcat versions are the same.
* If your Tomcat server runs Linux, declare the _shared libraries_ (`<pathToCbl>/support`) in the `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh` script file -- see: _Additional Steps for Linux_ section in {cbl--xref} gs-prereqs.adoc[Prerequisites].
* Ensure the {cbl} jars (`<pathToCbl>/lib`) are on the executable path within Tomcat -- see: <<bmkMultCblJapps>>
+

TIP: This also means you should declare the dependencies as `providedCompile` to avoid them being bundled into the `WEB-INF/libs` folder

=== Steps

. Create a project folder and initialize it for a Gradle Java application
+
[source, bashrc]
----
gradle init
----

. Create your `build.gradle` file, including the <<ex-bgf2>> in your app-level build.gradle:

. Open the project folder in Intellij IDEA and import the gradle settings.

TIP: If you don't have auto-import set for Gradle projects, then accept the   *Import Gradle Project* prompt that is displayed bottom-right of the screen. +
Note the Gradle menu at the extreme right of the screen: +
image::GradleMenuWebApp.png[,300]

If you want to deploy your app to a local tomcat container then see <<Deploying a WAR file to tomcat>>

That's it.
You're all set to start building your own {cbl} on {JP} applications -- see xref:gs-build.adoc[Building a Getting Started App] for an example of how to do that.

[#lbl-tomcat]
== Embedded Tomcat

The simplest way to build and deploy your {cbl} on {JP} web app is to use a gradle plugin that provides a simple Tomcat harness.

Our examples are based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin -- see https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin[com.bmuschko.tomcat on Github].

Including the plugin in your `build.gradle` file make a number of tomcat tasks available to you. View them using:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew tasks
----

This shows that the following web application tasks are now available:

** `tomcatJasper` - Runs the JSP compiler and turns JSP pages into Java source.
** `tomcatRun` - Uses your files as and where they are and deploys them to Tomcat.
** `tomcatRunWar` - Assembles the web app into a war and deploys it to Tomcat.
** `tomcatStop` - Stops Tomcat.

So, to run the app use:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew tomcatRun
----

[#lbl-war]
== Deploying a WAR File

To deploy your web app to a local Tomcat instance you need to generate a WAR file.
However, you should note that when creating a war file, if you use the `implementation` dependency type then your _{cbl}_ jar files will be bundled into WEB-INF/lib of the web application.
To exclude {cbl} jar files from getting bundled and to use {cbl} in multiple web applications, change the dependency type from *`implementation`* to *`providedCompile`*

. You can do this using the Gradle command below from within your project folder:
[source, bashrc]
+
----
./gradlew war
----
+
NOTE:  The generated war file will be at <PROJECT ROOT>/build/libs.


. Deploy the war file to Tomcat, by copying it to $CATALINA_BASE/webapps
+
TIP: You can also use Tomcatâs Manager App to deploy the war file -- see https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html[Tomcat's Manager App] documentation for more detail.

. To use common class loader approach to load {cbl} libraries, copy all of the {cbl} jar files in $CATALINA_BASE/lib.
