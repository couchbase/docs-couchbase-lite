== Build a Getting Started App

This section explains how to validate your configured build environment by building a starter app that uses many of {cblJP}'s more common features.

// TIP: The {nmMobStarterApp} app can be downloaded from GitHub link:{url-cb-mobStarterApp}[{nmMobStarterApp}].

The {nmMobStarterApp} app demonstrates how to use {cblJP}. Console and Web App versions are available.

Desktop App::

--

TIP: Ensure you added the {cbl} dependency to your `build.gradle` file

Create, build and run a new project using the following `GettingStarted.java` code:


[source,java]
----
include::example$GetStartedDesktop/src/main/java/com/couchbase/gettingstarted/Main.java[tags=getting-started,indent=0]
----

<.> Initialize the library
<.> Create a database
<.> Create a collection
<.> Create a new document
<.> Retrieve document and log its ID
<.> Retrieve the document as mutable and change the `language` to `Kotlin` and save it
<.> Query the database output count and id to log
<.> Optionally, initiate a replication

On running the app, you should see the document ID and property printed to the console together with a query result showing the number of rows in the database.

This shows the document was successfully persisted to the database.

See <<About the Getting Started App>> for more on the app itself

Web App::
+
--

This section explains how to set-up a build project to create {cblJP} web apps using {gpBuildTool} and {gpIDE}.

*Steps*

. Create a new project folder and add a `build.gradle` file similar to this one.
+
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
include::example$GetStartedWS/build.gradle.sample
----

. Within {gpIDE}, open the new project folder
+
If you don't have auto-import enabled, then accept the *Import from Gradle* prompt that appears at the bottom right of the screen.
. Create a Java class _DBManager_ using this code:
+
[source, java]

----
include::example$GetStartedWS/src/main/java/com/couchbase/gettingstarted/DBManager.java[tags=getting-started,indent=0]
----

. Create a Servlet similar to the one found in the example GettingStartedServlet
+
. Create an `index.html` file in `src/main/web app` with the following content:
+
[source, html]

----
include::example$GetStartedWS/src/main/webapp/index.html
----

. Create a `showDbItems.jsp` file in `src/main/web app` with the following content:
+
[source, html]

----
include::example$GetStartedWS/src/main/webapp/showDbItems.jsp
----

. Build, deploy and run the app using `jettyRun`
+
// !!!GBM: THIS IMAGE PROBABLY NEEDS UPDATING
image::GradleMenuWebApp.png[,300]

.. Point your browser to: `localhost:8080/'
+
This opens the browser at your index.html page.
..  Select the *here* link
+
This launches the servlet and displays the results in `showdDbItems.jsp`.

About the Starter App::
+
--

anchor:bmkAboutGettingStarted[]
The {nmMobStarterApp} app will:

* Create a database
+
The app creates its database in the `{nmSampleAppDbPath}` directory relative to its root location when run (See: {loc--finding-db-file--xref}).

TIP: Explicitly state your required database location when creating your database (see: {loc--finding-db-file--xref} for how to do this)

* Add content to the DB
* Run a simple query counting the DB rows
* Start a one-shot, bi-directional replication using {sg} and {svr}
* Produce a simple report on the db Contents
+
// !!!GBM: THIS IMAGE PROBABLY NEEDS UPDATING
image::java:cblOutput.png[,400]

NOTE: Before starting your app ensure you have started both your {svr} and {sg} instances.
