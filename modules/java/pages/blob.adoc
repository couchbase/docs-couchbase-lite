== What Are Blobs?

We've renamed "attachments" to "blobs".
The new behavior should be clearer too, as a `Blob` is now a normal object that can appear in a document as a property value.

== Using Blobs
So to uses a `blob`, you just instantiate it and set it as the value of a property.
Later you can get the property value, which will be a `Blob` object.

[#add-a-blob]
.Add a blob to a document
====
This example shows code that adds a blob to the document under the `avatar` property.

====

The `Blob` API lets you access the contents as an in-memory byte array (
`public byte[] getContent()`) or as an `InputStream` (`public InputStream getContentStream()`).
It also supports an optional `type` property that by convention stores the MIME type of the contents.

In <<add-a-blob>>, "image/jpeg" is the MIME type and "avatar" is the key which references that `Blob`.
That key can be used to retrieve the `Blob` object at a later time.

== Synchronization Behaviour
When a document is synchronized, the Couchbase Lite replicator will add an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains a blob.

A random access name will be generated for each `Blob` which is different to the "avatar" key that was used in the example above.

On the image below, the document now contains the `_attachments` dictionary when viewed in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.

This `Blob` can be retrieved on the Sync Gateway REST API at \http://localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1.
Notice that the blob identifier in the URL path is "blob_1" (not "avatar").

== Properties
A blob also has properties such as `"digest"` (a SHA-1 digest of the data), `"length"` (the length in bytes), and optionally `"content_type"` (the MIME type).
The data is not stored in the document, but in a separate content-addressable store, indexed by the digest.
