// == Getting Started

== Visual Studio Project

Create or open an existing Visual Studio project and install Couchbase Lite using the following method.

== Nuget

. Install either of the following packages from Nuget.
+
.Couchbase Lite Community Edition
Install the `Couchbase.Lite` package.
+
.Couchbase Lite Enterprise Edition
Install the `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise` package.
+
NOTE: Nuget packages can be installed via `PackageReference` or `packages.config`.
It is recommended to use the `PackageReference` style of dependency management because there is a strict version requirement between Couchbase Lite and its dependent Support library (`Couchbase.Lite.Support.<Platform>` and `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.<Platform>` for Community and Enterprise respectively).
If you are using `packages.config`, you must take extra care when upgrading the package to make sure that the support library is also updated to the exact same version.
Versions that are not the same are incompatible with each other.
+

. Your app must call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.
There is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency.
+
For example, UWP looks like `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`.
Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (i.e., csharp will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags.
No more "mono-stdout" always at info level.)

== Starter code

Open *Main.cs* in Visual Studio and copy the following code in the `main` method.
This snippet demonstrates how to run basic CRUD operations, a simple Query and running bi-directional replications with Sync Gateway.

Build and run.
You should see the document ID and property printed to the console.
The document was successfully persisted to the database.

== Supported Versions

Couchbase Lite .NET is a .NET Standard 2.0 library.
The following tables list out the supported platforms.

=== Officially Supported

Runtimes which have received more testing and are *officially* supported are:

|===
|.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version

|.NET Core Win
|2.0
|10 (any Microsoft supported)

|.NET Framework
|4.6.1
|10 (any Microsoft supported)

|UWP
|6.0.1
|10.0.16299

|Xamarin iOS
|10.14
|10.3.1

|Xamarin csharp
|API 26
|API 22

API 19,20,21 [DEPRECATED]
|===

.Deprecation
[NOTE]
include::{root-partials}block-deprecations.adoc[tag=api192021]

=== Not Officially Supported

The following runtimes are also compatible but are not QE tested.
So they are not officially supported.

|===
|.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version

|.NET Core Mac
|2.0
|10.12

|.NET Core Linux
|2.0
|n/a*
|===

*{sp}There are many different variants of Linux, and we don't have the resources to test all of them.
They are tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but have been shown to work on CentOS, and in theory work on any distro supported by .NET Core.

Comparing this to the https://docs-archive.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/1.4/csharp..html#supported-versions[supported versions] in 1.x you can see we've traded some lower obsolete versions for new platform support.
