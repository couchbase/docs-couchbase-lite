== Introduction
In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object--a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects.
Every document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.

== Initializers

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The `MutableDocument()` constructor can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The `MutableDocument(string documentID)` constructor can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.
* The `database.GetDocument(string documentID)` method can be used to get a document.
If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.

== Mutability

By default, when a document is read from the database it is immutable.
The `document.toMutable()` method should be used to create an instance of the document which can be updated.

Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `saveDocument` method is called.

== Typed Accessors

The `Document` class now offers a set of {url-api-references}/api/Couchbase.Lite.DictionaryObject.html[`property accessors`] for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point and strings.
These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

In addition, as a convenience we offer `DateTimeOffset` accessors.
Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.
The following example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the `document.GetDate(string key)` accessor method.

[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=date-getter,indent=0]
----

If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default value for that getter method (0 for `getInt`, 0.0 for `getFloat` etc.).
To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use the {url-api-references}/api/Couchbase.Lite.Document.html#Couchbase_Lite_Document_Contains_System_String_[`Document.Contains(string key)`] method.

== Batch operations

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=batch,indent=0]
----

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

== Document Expiration
