Where a database goes by default depends on the platform it is running on.
Here are the defaults for each platform:

// tag::list-only[]

* .NET Core: `Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "CouchbaseLite")` (unless the app context is altered [e.g. by XUnit], this will be the same directory as the output binary)
* UWP: `Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.Path` (Inside the installed app sandbox.
Note that this sandbox gets deleted sometimes when debugging from inside Visual Studio when the app is shutdown)
* iOS: In a folder named CouchbaseLite inside of `ApplicationSupportDirectory` (this can be retrieved more easily from the simulator using the https://simpholders.com/3/[SimPholders] utility)
* Android: Using the `Context` passed in the `Activate()` method, `Context.FilesDir.AbsolutePath` (database can be retrieved using adb)
