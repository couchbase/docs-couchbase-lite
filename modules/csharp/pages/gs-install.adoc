+
* Community Edition -- `Couchbase.Lite` package for {version-full}

* Enterprise Edition -- `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise` package for {version-full}

. Within your app, include a call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.
****

That's it! +
You should be ready to build you app using this version.
The rest of this content contains more detail, for those who want tp know more about the install or who encountered issues


== Install Methods

Nuget packages can be installed via _PackageReference_ or _packages.config_.

=== Package Reference
This is the recommended method of dependency management because it supports the strict version requirement between the core _Couchbase Lite for .Net_ package and its dependent Support library, which comprises:

.`Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.WinUI`

.`Couchbase.Lite`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.WinUI`


=== Package Config

If you are using `packages.config`, you must take extra care when upgrading the package to make sure that the support libraries you require are also updated to the exact same version.

NOTE: Versions that are not the same are incompatible with each other -- see:
https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Comparative Table]


== Activating

Within your app, include a call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.

There is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency.

For example, UWP looks like: +
`Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`

Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (So, C# will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags. No more "mono-stdout" always at info level.)
