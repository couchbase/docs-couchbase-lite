. Create or open an existing Visual Studio project

. Install either of the following packages from Nuget.
+
* Community Edition -- `Couchbase.Lite` package for {version-full}

* Enterprise Edition -- `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise` package for {version-full}

. Within your app, include a call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.
====

That's it! +
You should be ready to build you app using this version.

== Install Methods

Nuget packages can be installed via _PackageReference_ or _packages.config_.

=== Package Reference
This is the recommended method of dependency management because it supports the strict version requirement between the core _Couchbase Lite for .Net_ package and its dependent Support library, which comprises:

.`Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.NetDesktop`

.`Couchbase.Lite`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.NetDesktop`


=== Package Config

If you are using `packages.config`, you must take extra care when upgrading the package to make sure that the support libraries you require are also updated to the exact same version.

NOTE: Versions that are not the same are incompatible with each other -- see:
https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Comparative Table]


== Activating

Within your app, include a call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.

There is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency.

For example, UWP looks like: +
`Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`

Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (So, C# will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags. No more "mono-stdout" always at info level.)


== Using Downloaded Packages

You will need to add the location of your unpacked download package as a local nuget feed.

Within Visual Studio::
. menu:Settings[Options > Nuget Package Manager > Package Sources]
. btn:[Add] and add the path/to/your/unpacked/download
. btn:[OK] to continue

. Within Nuget Package Manger, select the *New Source* from _Package Sources_ drop down list
. Select *Use Prereleases* to access Couchbase Lite Beta packages

You should now be able to add the nuget package as normal.
