== Install Methods

Couchbase recommends installing Nuget packages via _PackageReference_.

=== Package Reference
This is the recommended method of dependency management because it supports the strict version requirement between the core _Couchbase Lite for .Net_ package and its dependent Support library, which comprises:

.`Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.WinUI`

.`Couchbase.Lite`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Support.WinUI`

=== Installing Vector Search

==== Package Reference

.`Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.UWP`

* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.WinUI`

.`Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch`
* `Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch.Support.UWP`
* `Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch.Support.ios`
* `Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch.Support.android`
* `Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch.Support.NetDesktop`
* `Couchbase.Lite.VectorSearch.Support.WinUI`

== Activating (on Android platform only)

Within your Android app, include a call to the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.

There is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency.

For example, UWP looks like: +
`Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`

Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (So, C# will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags. No more "mono-stdout" always at info level.)
