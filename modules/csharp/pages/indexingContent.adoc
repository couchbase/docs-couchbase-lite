=== Indexing

Before we begin querying documents, let's briefly mention the importance of having a query index.
A query can only be fast if there's a pre-existing database index it can search to narrow down the set of documents to examine.

The following example creates a new index for the `type` and `name` properties.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=query-index,indent=0]
----

If there are multiple expressions, the first one will be the primary key, the second the secondary key, etc.

NOTE: Every index has to be updated whenever a document is updated, so too many indexes can hurt performance.
Thus, good performance depends on designing and creating the _right_ indexes to go along with your queries.
