// == Getting Started

// === Visual Studio Project

// Create or open an existing Visual Studio project and install Couchbase Lite using the following method.

// === Nuget

// . Install either of the following packages from Nuget.
// +
// .Couchbase Lite Community Edition
// Install the `Couchbase.Lite` package.
// +
// .Couchbase Lite Enterprise Edition
// Install the `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise` package.
// +
// NOTE: Nuget packages can be installed via `PackageReference` or `packages.config`.
// It is recommended to use the `PackageReference` style of dependency management because there is a strict version requirement between Couchbase Lite and its dependent Support library (`Couchbase.Lite.Support.<Platform>` and `Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise.Support.<Platform>` for Community and Enterprise respectively).
// If you are using `packages.config`, you must take extra care when upgrading the package to make sure that the support library is also updated to the exact same version.
// Versions that are not the same are incompatible with each other.
// +
// https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Comparative Table]
// . Your app must call the relevant `Activate()` function inside of the class that is included in the support assembly.
// There is only one public class in each support assembly, and the support assembly itself is a nuget dependency.
// +
// For example, UWP looks like `Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP.Activate()`.
// Currently the support assemblies provide dependency injected mechanisms for default directory logic, and platform specific logging (i.e., csharp will log to logcat with correct log levels and tags.
// No more "mono-stdout" always at info level.)

// === Starter code

// Open *Main.cs* in Visual Studio and copy the following code in the `main` method.
// This snippet demonstrates how to run basic CRUD operations, a simple Query and running bi-directional replications with Sync Gateway.

// [source, {source-language}]

// Build and run.
// You should see the document ID and property printed to the console.
// The document was successfully persisted to the database.

// See also -- {xref-sgw-pg-install}

// == Supported Versions

// Couchbase Lite .NET is a .NET Standard 2.0 library.
// The following tables list out the supported platforms.

// === Officially Supported

// Runtimes which have received more testing and are *officially* supported are:

// |===
// |.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version

// |.NET Core Win
// |2.0
// |10 (any Microsoft supported)

// |.NET Framework
// |4.6.1
// |10 (any Microsoft supported)

// |UWP
// |6.0.1
// |10.0.16299

// |Xamarin iOS
// |10.14
// |10.3.1

// |Xamarin csharp
// |API 26
// |API 22

// API 19,20,21 [DEPRECATED]
// |===

// NOTE: Support for API 19, API 20 and API 21 is deprecated in this release.
// Support will be removed within two (non-maintenance) releases following the deprecation announcement.

// === Not Officially Supported

// The following runtimes are also compatible but are not QE tested.
// So they are not officially supported.

// |===
// |.NET Runtime |Minimum Runtime Version |Minimum OS version

// |.NET Core Mac
// |2.0
// |10.12

// |.NET Core Linux
// |2.0
// |n/a*
// |===

// *{sp}There are many different variants of Linux, and we don't have the resources to test all of them.
// They are tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but have been shown to work on CentOS, and in theory work on any distro supported by .NET Core.

// Comparing this to the https://docs-archive.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/1.4/csharp..html#supported-versions[supported versions] in 1.x you can see we've traded some lower obsolete versions for new platform support.
