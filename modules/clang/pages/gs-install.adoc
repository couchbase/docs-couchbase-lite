|``**lcblite**``
| The core library package for running

|``**lcblite-dev**``

=== Install from Download

[#lbl-linux-steps]
====
. *Download* and *Unpack* the release package
. From within the root directory, {rootdir},
.. Copy the following directories to a location already in the system path (for example, `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/lib`)
**  lcblite
**  lcblite-dev
+
Your compiler will detect them automatically with no alterations needed

.. Alternatively:
... Add the `lcblite` location to your compiler's include path -- `<path-to>/lcblite`
... Add the `lcblite-dev` location to your compiler's linker search path -- `<path-to>/lcblite`

. Link with the binaries library using, for example, `gcc  -lcblite`.
====


If you are familiar with _CMake_, then you can use this as a method of creating cross-platform projects; including Couchbase Lite itself.
As a convenience, the release package includes a _CMake_ file in `lib/cmake/CouchbaseLite`


[#install-windows]
== Windows

To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Windows from a downloaded release package:

[#lbl-windows-steps]
. Download and extract the release package from http://tbd
+
Ensure you select the correct package for your application's compiler and architecture.
// codesign -sv <location>/lib/libcblite.3.dylib (note if you don't have an Apple developer account this won't work)
. From within the root directory, {rootdir}, deploy the `lib`, `include` and `bin` libraries to a location accessible to your compiler.

. Within  _Visual Studio_:
.. *Create* a new C++ project
+
Be sure to select x64 for 64-bit builds
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Include Directories*
... *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/include`
... *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/lib`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *Linker* -> *Input* -> *Additional Dependencies*, *Add* `cblite.lib`
. *Copy* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/bin/cblite.dll` to your build location
+
Couchbase Lite for C does not have any preferred installation path for the `.dll`.
It is up to you to determine where best to place it so it is available during execution, though copying to a location on the system path is not recommended on Windows

You will now be able to build and run your app .


== Mac OS

To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Mac OS X from a downloaded release package:

[#lbl-mac-steps]
. Download and extract the release package from http://tbd
// codesign -sv <location>/lib/libcblite.3.dylib (note if you don't have an Apple developer account this won't work)
. From within the root directory, {rootdir}, *Copy* the `include` and `lib` folders to `/usr/local/`
. Within  _Xcode_:
.. *Create* a new project
.. *Add* `/usr/local/include` to the project's _Header Search Path_
.. *Add* `/usr/local/lib` to the project's _Library Search Path_
.. *Drag* `libcblite.3.dylib` into your Xcode project, then within the dialog:
... *Select* _Create Folder References If Needed_
... *Check* the correct target is selected

You will now be able to build and run your app from Xcode.
