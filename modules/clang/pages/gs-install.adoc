== Download Contents

_Couchbase Lite for C_ **beta** is available as a compressed binary download -- see: https://tbd
The unpacked download's root directory ({rootdir}) contains these directories:

* `lib` +
  The `lib` folder contains binaries and other packaging components
* `include` +
  The `include` directory contains all the headers that the library offers
* `bin` (*Windows-only*) +
   Contains the Couchbase Lite for C `.dll` files.

Installation will vary by platform and compiler, but you can use these steps to install Couchbase Lite for C on any of the supported platforms -- see <<lbl-steps>>.

WARNING: For BETA releases, only the downloadable binary release option is available

[#lbl-steps]
== How-to Install
====
[{tabs}]
=====
Linux::
+
--
[#lbl-linux-repos]
The various Linux distributions contain the following packages within the root directory, {rootdir}:

[#tbl-linux-pkgs,cols="1,4", options="noheader"]
|===

|`lib`
| The core library package for running

|`include`
|The headers and development files for _inclusion_

|===


[#lbl-linux-steps]
. *Download* and *Unpack* the binary release
. From within the root directory, {rootdir}, copy the following directories to an appropriate location
***  lib
***  include

+
TIP: If you copy these to locations already in the system path (for example, `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/lib`), then your compiler will detect them automatically with no alterations needed

. Add the `lib` location to your compiler library search path (`-L`) -- `<path-to>/lib`
. Add the `include` location to your compiler's include path (`-I`) -- `<path-to>/include`

. Link with the binaries library using, for example, `gcc  -lcblite`.

If you are familiar with _CMake_, then you can use this as a method of creating cross-platform projects; including Couchbase Lite itself.
As a convenience, the release package includes a _CMake_ file in `lib/cmake/CouchbaseLite`

Windows::
+
--
To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Windows from a downloaded release binary:

[#lbl-windows-steps]
. Download and extract the release package from http://tbd
+
Ensure you select the correct package for your application's compiler and architecture.
// codesign -sv <location>/lib/libcblite.3.dylib (note if you don't have an Apple developer account this won't work)
. From within the root directory, {rootdir}, deploy the `lib`, `include` and `bin` libraries to a location accessible to your compiler.

. Within  _Visual Studio_:
.. *Create* a new C++ project
+
Be sure to select x64 for 64-bit builds
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Library Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/lib`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Include Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/include`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *Linker* -> *Input* -> *Additional Dependencies*, *Add* `cblite.lib`
. *Copy* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/bin/cblite.dll` to your build location
+
Couchbase Lite for C does not have any preferred installation path for the `.dll`.
It is up to you to determine where best to place it so it is available during execution, though copying to a location on the system path is not recommended on Windows

Mac OS::

To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Mac OS X from a downloaded release package:

[#lbl-mac-steps]
. Download and extract the release package from http://tbd
// codesign -sv <location>/lib/libcblite.3.dylib (note if you don't have an Apple developer account this won't work)
. Ootionally ... From within the root directory, {rootdir}, *Copy* the `include` and `lib` folders to `/usr/local/`
. Within  _Xcode_:
.. *Create* a new project
.. *Add* `<path/to>/include` to the project's _Header Search Path_
.. *Add* `<path/to>/lib` to the project's _Library Search Path_
.. *Drag* `libcblite.3.dylib` into your Xcode project, then within the dialog:
... *Select* _Create Folder References If Needed_
... *Check* the correct target is selected
--
=====

On completion of the above steps you will be able to build and run your app.
