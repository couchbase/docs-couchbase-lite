A Prerelease version of Couchbase Lite EE 2.8 {param-platform} framework is available for download from the <<download-links, Download Links>> section.

In this release Couchbase Lite provides support for out-of-the-box peer-to-peer sync, over websockets, between Couchbase Lite enabled clients in IP-based networks.

* We are now providing a replication listener API and implementation that uses WebSocket protocol as a solution for developers to use for their peer-to-peer synchronization. The feature of the listener API can be summarized as a list here.
* Provide a replication listener for a single database with an option to allow only pull replication.
* Support TLS communication by default and could be disabled.
* Support an auto-generated anonymous TLS Identity if the TLS Identity is not specified.
* Support two types of authentication:
* Password Authentication
* Client Certificate Authentication as a part of TLS Communication
* Provide connection status information.
* A utility API to programmatically generate a self-sign certificate.
