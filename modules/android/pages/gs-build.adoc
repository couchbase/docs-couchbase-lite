== Introduction


The Getting Started app is a very basic Android app comprising a simple activity, which runs a set of {cbl-te} CRUD functions, logging progress and output.

You can access the `GettingStarted` project on github here: +
{url-getting-started-ktx} |  {url-getting-started-java}

.Quick Steps
****
. Get the project and open it in Android Studio: {url-getting-started-ktx} |  {url-getting-started-java}
. Build it
. Run it
+
Android Studio's Logcat panel will show `INFO` output similar to that in <<img-output>>:
. That's it.
****

If you had problems, or just want more information on the app, there's more below.

Those errors at the end of the run?
They are because no Sync Gateway was running.
That's optional code -- see below.
Comment-it-out or remove it if you aren't planning on running {sgw-te}.

== Getting Started App
The Getting Started app shows examples of the essential Couchbase for Android CRUD operations, including:

* Create database
* Create and save a document
* Retrieve a document
* Update a document
* Query documents
* Configure a replication
* Initiate a replication

Whilst no exemplar of a real application, it will give you a good idea how to get started using Couchbase Lite.


== Add the App to Your Own Project


. Create a new 'empty activity' project
 in Android Studio
. Open the `MainActivity`
. Delete the exiting generated content
. Paste-in the code show in <<ex-test-code>>
. Build and run. +
You should see the document ID and property printed to the console.
The document was successfully persisted to the database.

<.> Retrieve the document as mutable and change the `language` to `Java` and save it

== Snags and Pitfalls


Mostly around Gradle and versions.
You may find you need to change the project settings to use Java 11 for instance.

Using this app with Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server obviously requires you have, or install, working versions of both.

== Minification


An application that enables minification must ensure that certain pieces of {cbl} library code are not changed -- see <<ruleset>> for a near-minimal rule set that retains the needed code:

[#ruleset]
.Ruleset
====
[source, {source-language}]
----
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.ConnectionStatus { <init>(...); }
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.LiteCoreException { static <methods>; }
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.internal.core.C4* {
    static <methods>;
    <fields>;
    <init>(...);
 }
