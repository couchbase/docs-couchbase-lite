== Minification
An application that enables minification must ensure that certain pieces of Couchbase Lite library code are not changed -- see <<ruleset>> for a near-minimal rule set that retains the needed code:

[#ruleset]
.Ruleset
====
[source, {source-language}]
----
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.ConnectionStatus { <init>(...); }
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.LiteCoreException { static <methods>; }
-keep class com.couchbase.lite.internal.core.C4* {
    static <methods>;
    <fields>;
    <init>(...);
 }
----

== Running

Open *MainActivity.java* in Android Studio and copy the following code in the `onCreate` method.
This snippet demonstrates how to run basic CRUD operations, a simple Query and running bi-directional replications with Sync Gateway.
