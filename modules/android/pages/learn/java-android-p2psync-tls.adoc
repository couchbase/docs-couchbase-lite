== Overview

Couchbase's replication listener API and implementation uses WebSocket protocol as a solution for developers to use peer-to-peer replication in their applications.

The introduction of the _WebsocketEndpointListener_ allows developers to implement peer-to-peer replication without navigating the compexity of the MessageEndpoint API, which can often be a barrier.

The listener API features comprise:

* A replication listener for a single database with an option to allow only pull replication
* Support TLS communication by default (can be disabled)
* Support an auto-generated anonymous TLS Identity if the TLS Identity is not specified.
* Support two types of authentication:
** Password Authentication
** Client Certificate Authentication as a part of TLS Communication
** Provide connection status information.
** A utility API to programmatically generate a self-sign certificate.
*
