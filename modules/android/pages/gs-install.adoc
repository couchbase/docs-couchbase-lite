== Introduction

.3.0 BETA Downloads
[IMPORTANT]
You can install Community and-or Enterprise editions of the 3.0.0 (beta) from Maven or get direct download binaries of Couchbase Lite for Android here -- {downloads-mobile--xref}.

Couchbase Lite on Android 3.0.0 (beta) supports the development of applications in Java or {kotlin--xref}.
You can install Kotlin and-or Java from (separate) downloads or by using the Maven repository.
When using Maven, selecting Kotlin will also pull-in the pure Java version.
Users requiring only Java can choose to just pull the Java version.
