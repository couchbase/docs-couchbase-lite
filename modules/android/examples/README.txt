The gradle files in this directory are here only to simplify the process of testing
the four separate applications in sub-dirctories: GetStartedKotlin, GetStartedJava, java_snippet, kotlin_snippets
To check the code, from this directory, just run the command `gradlew smokeTest`

To actually edit any of the code, open one of the subdirectories.  Trying to run your IDE in this directory
will not work.

Note that many of the code snippets for Android Java are over in
  ../../../../java/examples/snippets/common/main/java
