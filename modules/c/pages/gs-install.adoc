[#lbl-apt]
=== Using APT

:url-apt-pkg-file: couchbase-release-1.0-noarch.deb
:url-apt-pkg:  pass:q,a[https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/{url-apt-pkg-file}]

Using the Advanced Package Tool (apt) is the easiest way to install {cbl-t} on Ubuntu and Debian platforms.
Just download the meta package that _apt_ requires to automatically get and install {cbl-t}, including any dependencies.

. Download the meta package

[#lbl-deb]
=== Using .deb Package

Use your package manager to install from a local `.deb` file.

. Just `wget` the appropriate `.deb` package  -- see <<lbl-downloads, downloads table>>  for a package URL.

. Install the package and its dependency, using `apt install`

** For community version:
+
[{bash-header}]
----

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-ce}

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-dev-ce}

----

** For enterprise version:
+
[{bash-header}]
----
sudo apt install ./{release-dir-ee}

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-dev-ee}

----

. From here, you need to pass the `-lcblite` command-line flag to the compiler when you build.

{install-closure}

=== Install Vector Search for Linux

Before you can use Vector Search, you must link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-lite#LiteExtensions[download and install the Vector Search library] to the location in your project where the library can be accessed and loaded at run time.
The Vector Search extension for the C platform ships with supported prebuilt libraries containing the required dependencies.

You need to set the `LD_LIBRARIES_PATH` to the extension location instead of installing the libraries yourself.

In the code, before opening the database and using the vector search extension, you must call the CBL_SetExtensionPath function shown below to set the path to the installed location of the vector search library.

[#lbl-windows]
== Install for Windows
To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Windows from a downloaded release binary:


[#lbl-windows-steps]
. Download and extract the release package -- see: link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/#extend-with-mobile?family=couchbase-lite[Mobile & Edge]

. From within the root directory, {release-dir-ce}, deploy the `lib`, `include` and `bin` libraries to a location accessible to your compiler.

. Within  _Visual Studio_:
.. *Create* a new C++ project
+
Be sure to select x64 for 64-bit builds
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Library Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/lib`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Include Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/include`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *Linker* -> *Input* -> *Additional Dependencies*, *Add* `cblite.lib`
. *Copy* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/bin/cblite.dll` to your build location
+
Couchbase Lite for C does not have any preferred installation path for the `.dll`.
It is up to you to determine where best to place it so it is available during execution, though copying to a location on the system path is not recommended on Windows

=== Install Vector Search for Windows

To use the Vector Search extension:

. Download and extract the link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-lite#LiteExtensions[Vector Search extension].
. Put the library in your development environment.

In the code, before opening the database and using the vector search extension, you must call the CBL_SetExtensionPath function shown below to set the path to the installed location of the vector search library.

NOTE: Couchbase Lite Vector Search does not have any preferred installation path for the `.dll`. It is up to you to determine where best to place it so it is available during execution.

[#lbl-macos]
== Install for macOS

// CAUTION: Direct access from Swift to Couchbase Lite for C is not possible in this release footnote:[3.0], but will be available in the next release.

.Install with Homebrew
****
Simplified installation using Homebrew +

* `brew install {release-dir-ee}` +

* `brew install {release-dir-ce}`

****

To install the Couchbase for C libraries on macOS from a downloaded release package:

[#lbl-mac-steps]
. Download and extract the release package here -- <<lbl-downloads, downloads table>>.
. Optionally ... From within the root directory, {release-dir-ce}, *Copy* the `include` and `lib` directories to `/usr/local/`
. Within  _Xcode_:
.. *Create* a new project
.. *Add* `<path/to>/include` to the project's _Header Search Path_
.. *Add* `<path/to>/lib` to the project's _Library Search Path_
.. *Drag* `{release-dir-ce}.dylib` into your Xcode project.
Then, within the dialog:
... *Select* _Create Directory References If Needed_
... *Check* the correct target is selected

{install-closure}

=== Install Vector Search for macOS

IMPORTANT: Couchbase does not support homebrew for installation of the Vector Search extension. 

Before you can use Vector Search, you must link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-lite#LiteExtensions[download and install the Vector Search library] to the location in your project where the library can be accessed and loaded at run time.

* CMake 3.18.1
* NDK 21.4.7075529
* Build tools 30.0.2

In this instance the release comprises a _ready to adapt_ application project.

. *Download* and *Unpack* the binary release here -- link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/#extend-with-mobile?family=couchbase-lite[Mobile & Edge]

. Within _Android Studio_, select and open the project folder (within the {release-dir-ce} folder)

. menu:Tools[SDK Manager > SDK Tools]

. Check the above dependencies are installed, select any that are not +
 btn:[OK] to Continue

Once the install is finished, you can build and run this skeleton app.

=== Install Vector Search for Android

To use Vector Search in your Android applications, follow the steps below:

. Download and extract the link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-lite#LiteExtensions[Vector Search extension] into your project location.
. The package must be installed to the location in your project where the library can be accessed and loaded while the executable is running.
.. The Vector Search download for CBL-C only contains the Vector Search libraries needed to include in your app.
.. Steps to include the prebuilt native library can be found link:https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/gradle-external-native-builds[here].
. Create a Android app project in Android Studio
