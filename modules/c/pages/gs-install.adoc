[#lbl-apt]
=== Using APT

:url-apt-pkg-file: couchbase-release-1.0-noarch.deb
:url-apt-pkg:  pass:q,a[https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/{url-apt-pkg-file}]

Using the Advanced Package Tool (apt) is the easiest way to install pass:q,a[pass:q,a[Couchbase{nbsp}Lite]] on Ubuntu and Debian platforms.
Just download the meta package that _apt_ requires to automatically get and install pass:q,a[pass:q,a[Couchbase{nbsp}Lite]], including any dependencies.

. Download the meta package

[#lbl-deb]
=== Using .deb Package

Use your package manager to install from a local `.deb` file.

. Just `wget` the appropriate `.deb` package  -- see <<lbl-downloads, downloads table>>  for a package URL.

. Install the package and its dependency, using `apt install`

** For community version:
+
[{bash-header}]
----

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-ce}

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-dev-ce}

----

** For enterprise version:
+
[{bash-header}]
----
sudo apt install ./{release-dir-ee}

sudo apt install ./{release-dir-dev-ee}

----

. That's it. +
You just need to pass the `-lcblite` command-line flag to the compiler when you build.

[#lbl-windows]
== Install for Windows
To install the Couchbase for C libraries on Windows from a downloaded release binary:


[#lbl-windows-steps]
. Download and extract the release package -- see: link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/#extend-with-mobile?family=couchbase-lite[Mobile & Edge]

. From within the root directory, {release-dir-ce}, deploy the `lib`, `include` and `bin` libraries to a location accessible to your compiler.

. Within  _Visual Studio_:
.. *Create* a new C++ project
+
Be sure to select x64 for 64-bit builds
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Library Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/lib`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *C++ directories* -> *Include Directories*, *Add* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/include`
.. Within *Project Properties* -> *Linker* -> *Input* -> *Additional Dependencies*, *Add* `cblite.lib`
. *Copy* `<path-to-deployed-directories>/bin/cblite.dll` to your build location
+
Couchbase Lite for C does not have any preferred installation path for the `.dll`.
It is up to you to determine where best to place it so it is available during execution, though copying to a location on the system path is not recommended on Windows


[#lbl-macos]
