****

**Use collections to organize your content in a database**

For example, if your database contains travel information, airport documents can be assigned to an airports collection, hotel documents can be assigned to a hotels collection, and so on.

* Document names must be unique within their collection.


**Use scopes to group multiple collections**

Collections can be assigned to different scopes according to content-type or deployment-phase (for example, test versus production).

* Collection names must be unique within their scope.

[discrete#c:scopes-collections-manage:::default-scopes-and-collections]
== Default Scopes and Collections

Every database you create contains a default scope and a default collection named _default.

If you create a document in the database and donâ€™t specify a specific scope or collection, it is saved in the default collection, in the default scope.

If you upgrade from a version of Couchbase Lite prior to 3.1, all existing data is automatically placed in the default scope and default collection.

The default scope  and collection cannot be dropped.


[discrete#c:scopes-collections-manage:::create-a-scope-and-collection]
== Create a Scope and Collection

In addition to the default scope and collection, you can create your own scope and collection when you create a document.

Naming conventions for collections and scopes:

* Must be between 1 and 251 characters in length.
* Can only contain the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and the symbols `_`, `-`, and `%`.
* Cannot start with `_` or `%`.
* Scope names must be unique in databases.
* Collection names must be unique within a scope.

NOTE: Scope and collection names are case sensitive.

In the example above, you can see that `db.createCollection()` can take two parameters.
The first is the scope assigned to the created collection, if this parameter is omitted then a collection of the given name will be assigned to the `_default` scope. In this case, creating a collection called `Verlaine`.

The second parameter is the name of the collection you want to create, in this case `Verlaine`.
In the second section of the example you can see `db.createCollection("Television", "Verlaine")`.
This creates the collection `Verlaine` and then checks to see if the scope `Television` exists.
If the scope `Television` exists, the collection `Verlaine` is assigned to the scope `Television`. If not, a new scope, `Television` is created and then the collection `Verlaine` is assigned to it.

NOTE: You cannot create an empty user-defined scope.
A scope is implicitly created in the `db.createCollection()` method.

NOTE: There is no need to drop a user-defined scope.
User-defined scopes are dropped when the collections associated with them contain no documents.
