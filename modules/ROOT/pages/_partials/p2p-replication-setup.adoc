==== Active Peer

When the connection is established, the active peer must instantiate a `MessageEndpoint` object corresponding to the remote peer.

The `MessageEndpoint` initializer takes the following arguments.

. `uid`: a unique ID that represents the remote active peer.
. `target`: This represents the remote passive peer and could be any suitable representation of the remote peer.
It could be an Id, URL etc.
If using the MultiPeerConnectivity Framework, this could be the MCPeerID.
. `protocolType`: specifies the kind of transport you intend to implement.
There are two options.
 ** The default (`MessageStream`) means that you want to "send a series of messages", or in other words the Communication Framework will control the formatting of messages so that there are clear boundaries between messages.
 ** The alternative (`ByteStream`) means that you just want to send raw bytes over the stream and Couchbase should format for you to ensure that messages get delivered in full.
+
Typically, the Communication Framework will handle message assembly and disassembly so you would use the `MessageType` option in most cases.

. `delegate`: the delegate that will implement the `MessageEndpointDelegate` protocol, which is a factory for `MessageEndpointConnection`.

Then, a `Replicator` is instantiated with the initialized `MessageEndpoint` as the target.

Next, Couchbase Lite will call back the application code through the `MessageEndpointDelegate.createConnection` interface method.
When the application receives the callback, it must create an instance of `MessageEndpointConnection` and return it.

Next, Couchbase Lite will call back the application code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.open` method.

The connection argument is then set on an instance variable.
The application code must keep track of every `ReplicatorConnection` associated with every `MessageEndpointConnection`.

The `MessageError` argument in the completion block is used to specify if the error is recoverable or not.
If it is a recoverable error, the replicator will kick off a retry process which will result to creating a new `MessageEndpointConnection` instance.

==== Passive Peer

The first step after connection establishment on the passive peer is to initialize a new `MessageEndpointConnection` and pass it to the listener.
This tells the listener to accept incoming data from that peer.

`messageEndpointListener` is the instance of the `MessageEndpointListener` that was created in the first step (xref:#peer-discovery[Peer Discovery])

Couchbase Lite will then call back the application code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.open` method.

The `connection` argument is then set on an instance variable.
The application code must keep track of every `ReplicatorConnection` associated with every `MessageEndpointConnection`.

At this point, the connection is established and both peers are ready to exchange data.
