=== Submission to the App Store

When submitting a build of your application to the App Store you must ensure that it doesn't contain any simulator architecture otherwise the upload will fail with the error message "Unsupported Architecture.
Your executable contains unsupported architecture '[x86_64, i386]'."

The steps to remove the simulator architecture (x86_64) from **CouchbaseLite.framework** are outlined below.
They depend on the method you chose to install Couchbase Lite:

The Couchbase Lite framework available on the link:https://couchbase.com/downloads[downloads page] contains a build for both the simulator (x86_64) and iOS devices (ARM).
The following steps describe how to set up a build phase in Xcode to do this automatically.

. In Xcode, open the *Build Phases* tab, then select the *+* > *Add Run Script Build Phase* option.

That's it, now every time you build and run your application, Xcode will remove binary architectures that do not match the target's architecture type (emulator or device).
