When a peer disconnects from a peer-to-peer network, all connected peers are notified.
The disconnect notification is a good opportunity to close and remove a replication connection.
The steps to teardown the connection are slightly different depending on whether it is the active or passive peer that disconnects first.
We will cover each case below.

==== Initiated by Active Peer

===== Active Peer

When an active peer disconnects, it must call the `ReplicatorConnection.close` method.

[source,{lang}]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=active-replicator-close]
----

Then, Couchbase Lite will call back your code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.close` to give the application a chance to disconnect with the Communication Framework.

[source,{lang}]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=active-peer-close]
----

===== Passive Peer

When the passive peer receives the corresponding disconnect notification from the Communication Framework, it must call the `ReplicatorConnection.close` method.

[source,{lang}]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=passive-replicator-close]
----

Then, Couchbase Lite will call back your code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.close` to give the application a chance to disconnect with the Communication Framework.

==== Initiated by Passive Peer

===== Passive Peer

When the passive disconnects, it must class the `MessageEndpointListener.closeAll` method.

[source,{lang}]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=passive-stop-listener]
----

Then, Couchbase Lite will call back your code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.close` to give the application a chance to disconnect with the Communication Framework.

[source,{lang}]

include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=passive-peer-close]

===== Active Peer

When the active peer receives the corresponding disconnect notification from the Communication Framework, it must call the `ReplicatorConnection.close` method.

[source,{lang}]

include::{examplesdir}/{snippetsdir}[tags=active-replicator-close]

Then, Couchbase Lite will call back your code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.close` to give the application a chance to disconnect with the Communication Framework.
