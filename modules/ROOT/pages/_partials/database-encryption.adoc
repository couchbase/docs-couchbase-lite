Couchbase Lite 2.1 introduces database encryption, this functionality is exclusively available in the Enterprise Edition.

If you're migrating an application from Couchbase Lite 1.x to 2.x, note that the xref:#database-upgrade[automatic database upgrade] functionality is *not supported* for encrypted databases. Furthermore, databases encrypted with one SDK (i.e Swift, C#, Java or Objective-C) *cannot* be opened with another SDK.

The encryption specification is 256-bit AES.

The code below demonstrates how to open or create an existing database with an encryption key. This code will not compile if you are running the Community Edition of Couchbase Lite.
