Couchbase Mobile 2.0 uses a new replication protocol based on WebSockets.

The replicator is designed to send documents from a source to a target database.
The target can be one of the following:

<<starting-sync-gateway, URLEndpoint>>::
To replicate data between a local Couchbase Lite database and remote Sync Gateway database.
<<database-replicas, DatabaseEndpoint>>::
To replicate data between two local Couchbase Lite databases to store data on secondary storage.
<<peer-to-peer-sync, MessageEndpoint>>::
To replicate with another Couchbase Lite database via a custom transportation protocol such iOS Multipeer Connectivity, Android WiFi Direct, Android NearByConnection, socket based transportation etc.
