TLSIdentity represents the identity information (Key pair and Certificates) used for setting up TLS Communication.
The TLSIdentity API differs from platform-to-platform.
This API is based on the {param-platform} platform.

----

|Explanation
|Use this method to get an identity from the Keychain with a `SecIdentity` object.
Any intermediate or root certificates required to identify the certificate but not present in the system wide set of trusted anchor certificates need to be specified in the optional `certs` parameter.


|Preconditions
|The specified SecIdentity object must be present in the KeyChain, otherwise an exception will be thrown. given label.

|Postconditions
|The identity returned from the secure storage.
If the identity doesn’t exist, this method will return null.

|Exceptions
|CouchbaseLiteException will be thrown if there is an error occurred while getting the identity from the secure storage.

createIdentity(isServer: Bool, attributes: Dictionary<String, String>?, expiration: Date?, label: String) throws -> TLSIdentity
----

|Objective
|Create and store a client self-signed identity in a secure storage. The identity will be stored in the secure storage using the given label.

The isServer tells that the certificate being created is a server or client certificate. The certificate attributes are optional. If the expiration date is not specified, the expiration date of the certificate will be 365 days.

When creating a certificate, the common name attribute is required for creating a CSR. If the common name is not presented in the certificate, an exception will be thrown.

|Preconditions
|N/A

|Postconditions
|A self-signed TLSIdentity. The identity is stored in the secure storage using the specified label.

|Exceptions
|CouchbaseLiteException will be thrown when the identity cannot be created.

*The error code will be determined during the technical design phase.*

importIdentity(data: Data, password: String?, label: String) throws -> TLSIdentity
----

|Explanation
|Create the identity from the given PKCS12 Data and password. The identity will be stored in the secure storage using the given label.

|Preconditions
|N/A

|Postconditions
|A TLSIdentity is created. The identity is stored in the secure storage using the specified label.

|Exceptions
|CouchbaseLiteException will be thrown when the identity cannot be created. The error code will be determined during the technical design phase.

CouchbaseLiteException will be thrown if the common name is not presented in the certificate.

----

|Explanation
|Delete the identity of the given label or alias from the secure storage.

|Preconditions
|N/A

|Postconditions
|The identity is deleted from the storage. If the identity doesn’t exist, this operation will be no-ops.

|Exceptions
|CouchbaseLiteException will be thrown when the identity cannot be deleted. The error code will be determined during the technical design phase.
