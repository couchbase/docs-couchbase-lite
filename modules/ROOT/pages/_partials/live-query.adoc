A live query stays active and monitors the database for changes.
A live query is a great way to build reactive user interfaces, especially table/list views, that keep themselves up to date.
For example, as the replicator runs and pulls new data from the server, a live query-driven UI will automatically update to show the data without the user having to manually refresh.
This helps your app feel quick and responsive.

<1> To start a live query, you must call `query.execute()`.
This will immediately execute the query and post the result to the change listener.
When there's a change it re-runs itself automatically, and posts the new query result to any observers (change listeners).

The following example stops the live query with the token from the previous example.
