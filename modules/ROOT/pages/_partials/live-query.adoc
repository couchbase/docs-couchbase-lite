== Activating a Live Query
A live query is a query that, once activated, remains active and monitors the database for changes; refreshing the result set whenever a change occurs.
As such, it is a great way to build reactive user interfaces -- especially table/list views -- that keep themselves up to date.

*So, a simple use case may be:* A replicator running and pulling new data from a server, whilst a live-query-driven UI automatically updates to show the data without the user having to manually refresh.
This helps your app feel quick and responsive.

[#ex-qry-start]
.Starting a LIve Query
====
[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=live-query,indent=0]

----

<.> Build the query statements using the QuerybUilder
<.> Activate the _live_ query by attaching a listener. +
Save the token in order to detach the listener and stop the query later -- se <<ex-qry-stop>>
<.> Start the query +
This will immediately execute the live query and post the result to the change listener.
When a change is detected the query automatically runs, and posts the new query result to any observers (change listeners).

[#ex-qry-stop]
.Stop a LIve Query
====
[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=stop-live-query,indent=0]

----

<.> Here we use the change lister token from <<ex-qry-start>> to remove the listeners.
Doing so stops the live query.
