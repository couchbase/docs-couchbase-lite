== Symbolication

In order to make sense of a crash report you will need to translate the crash log's memory addresses with human-readable function names and line numbers; this process is called _symbolication_.

To do this you will need to have debug symbol (`.dSYM`) files for the application and for Couchbase Lite on {param-title}'s framework.
