**Use collections to organize your content in a database**

For example, if your database contains travel information, airport documents can be assigned to an airports collection, hotel documents can be assigned to a hotels collection, and so on.

* You can create up to 1000 collections per database. 
* Document names must be unique within their collection.
* Applications can be assigned per-collection access-rights.



**Use scopes to group multiple collections** 

Collections can be assigned to different scopes according to content-type or deployment-phase (for example, test versus production). 

* You can create up to 1000 scopes per database. 
* Collection names must be unique within their scope. 
* Applications can be assigned per-scope access-rights so they can only access the scopes they require.

== Default Scopes and Collections

Every database you create contains a default scope and a default collection named _default. 

If you create a document in the database and donâ€™t specify a specific scope or collection, it is saved in the default collection, in the default scope. 

If you upgrade from a version of Couchbase Lite prior to 3.1, all existing data is automatically placed in the default scope and default collection.

The default scope  and collection cannot be dropped. 



== Create a Scope

In addition to the default, you can create your own scopes.

User-defined scopes:

* Must be between 1 and 251 characters in length.
* Can only contain the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and the symbols `_`, `-`, and `%`. 
* Cannot start with `_` or `%`.
* Scope names must be unique in databases. 
Collections names must be unique within a scope.

NOTE: Scope names are case sensitive.
