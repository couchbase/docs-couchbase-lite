== Introduction

Couchbase Lite for {param-title} provides API support for secure, bi-directional, synchronization of data changes between mobile applications and a central server database.
It does so by using a replicator to interact with Sync Gateway.
Simply put, the replicator is designed to send documents from a source to a target database.
In this case, between a local Couchbase Lite database and remote Sync Gateway database (server or cloud).

This content provides sample code and configuration examples covering the implementation of a replication using Sync Gateway.

Your application runs a replicator (also referred to here as a client), which  will initiate connection with a Sync Gateway (also referred to here as a server) and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both local and remote databases into sync.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.


== Replication Protocol

=== Scheme

Couchbase Mobile uses a replication protocol based on WebSockets fof replication.
To use this protocol the replication URL should specify WebSockets as the URL scheme (see the <<lbl-cfg-tgt>> section below).

Incompatibilities::
Couchbase Lite's replication protocol is *incompatible* with CouchDB-based databases.
And since Couchbase Lite 2.x+ only supports the new protocol, you will need to run a version of Sync Gateway that supports it -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-compatibility}.

Legacy Compatibility::
Clients using Couchbase Lite 1.x can continue to use `http` as the URL scheme.
Sync Gateway 2.x+ will automatically use:
* The 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects through `\http://localhost:4984/db`
* The 2.0 replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through `ws://localhost:4984/db`.

You can find further information in our blog: {url-cb-blog-replication}.

[#lbl-repl-ord]
=== Ordering

To optimize for speed, the replication protocol doesn't guarantee that documents will be received in a particular order.
So we don't recommend to rely on that when using the replication or database change listeners for example.

*Notes on Example*

<.> Use the {url-api-class-replicator-config} class's constructor -- {url-api-constructor-replicator-config-db-tgt} -- to initialize the replicator configuration with the local database -- see also: <<lbl-cfg-tgt>>

<.> Configure how the client will authenticate the server.
Here we say connect only to servers presenting a self-signed certificate.
By default, clients accept only servers presenting certificates that can be verified using the OS bundled Root CA Certificates -- see: <<lbl-svr-auth>>.

<.> Configure the credentials the client will present to the server.
Here we say to provide _Basic Authentication_ credentials. Other options are available -- see: <<lbl-client-auth>>.

<.> Configure how the replication should handle conflict resolution -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict} topic for mor on conflict resolution.

<.> Initialize the replicator using your configuration object -- see: <<lbl-init-repl>>.

<.> Optionally, register an observer, which will notify you of changes to the replication status -- see: <<lbl-repl-mon>>

<.> Start the replicator  -- see: <<lbl-repl-start>>.

=== Server Authentication

Define the credentials your app (the client) is expecting to receive from the Sync Gateway (the server) in order to ensure it is prepared to continue with the sync.

include::{root-commons}set-server-authentication.adoc[]

This all assumes that you have configured the Sync Gateway to provide the appropriate SSL certificates, and have included the appropriate certificate in your app bundle -- for more on this see: <<lbl-cert-pinning>>.

=== Delta Sync

// tag::rep-delta-sync-concept[]

include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tag=ee-only-feature]

With Delta Sync footnote:[Couchbase Mobile 2.5+], only the changed parts of a Couchbase document are replicated.
This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements, especially when network bandwidth is typically constrained.

Replications to a Server (for example, a Sync Gateway, or passive listener) automatically use delta sync if the property is enabled at database level by the server -- see: xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:refer/config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-delta_sync[databases.$db.delta_sync.enabled].

{xref-cbl-pg-dbreplica} replications automatically *disable* delta sync, whilst xref:{cbl-pg-p2psync-websocket}[Peer-to-Peer] replications automatically *enable* delta sync.

== Monitoring

In this section::
<<lbl-repl-chng>>  |  <<lbl-repl-status>>  |  <<lbl-repl-evnts>> | <<lbl-repl-pend>>

You can monitor a replicationâ€™s status by using a combination of <<lbl-repl-chng>> and the `replication.status.activity` property -- see; {url-api-enum-replicator-activity}.
This enables you to know, for example, when the replication is actively transferring data and when it has stopped.

You can also choose to monitor document changes -- see: <<lbl-repl-evnts>>.

// [#lbl-repl-status]
// === Replication Status
:is-p2p!:
include::{root-commons}sgw-replication-monitor.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[#lbl-repl-states]

==== Replication States

See <<tbl-states>> for a list of the different activity levels reported in the API; and the meaning of each.

.Replicator activity levels
[#tbl-states,cols="1,2"]
|===
|State |Meaning

|`STOPPED`
|The replication is finished or hit a fatal error.

|`OFFLINE`
|The replicator is offline as the remote host is unreachable.

|`CONNECTING`
|The replicator is connecting to the remote host.

|`IDLE`
|The replication caught up with all the changes available from the server.
The `IDLE` state is only used in continuous replications.

|`BUSY`
|The replication is actively transferring data.
|===

NOTE: The replication change object also has properties to track the progress (`change.status.completed` and `change.status.total`).
But since the replication occurs in batches and the total count can vary through the course of a replication, those progress indicators are not very useful from the standpoint of an app user.
Hence, these should not be used for tracking the actual progress of the replication.

include::{root-commons}sgw-replication-rep-status.adoc[tags={param-platform}]

[#lbl-repl-evnts]
=== Replication Events

You can choose to register for document updates during a replication.

TIP: You should register the listener before starting your replication, to avoid having to do a restart to activate it.

For example, the code snippet in <<ex-reg-doc-listener>> registers a listener to monitor document replication performed by the replicator referenced by the variable `replicator`.
It prints the document ID of each document received and sent.
Stop the listener as shown in <<ex-stop-doc-listener>>.

.Document Access Removal Behavior
--
When access to a document is removed on Sync Gateway (see: Sync Gateway's xref:sync-gateway::sync-function-api.adoc[Sync Function]), the document replication listener sends a notification with the `AccessRemoved` flag set to `true` and subsequently purges the document from the database.
--

[#lbl-repl-pend]
=== Documents Pending Push

TIP: {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} is quicker and more efficient.
Use it in preference to returning a list of pending document IDs, where possible.

You can check whether documents are waiting to be pushed in any forthcoming sync by using either of the following API methods:

* Use the {url-api-method-replicator-getPendingDocumentIds} method, which returns a list of document IDs that have local changes, but which have not yet been pushed to the server.
+
This can be very useful in tracking the progress of a push sync, enabling the app to provide a visual indicator to the end user on its status, or decide when it is safe to exit.

* Use the {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} method to quickly check whether an individual document is pending a push.

<.> {url-api-method-replicator-getPendingDocumentIds} returns a list of the document IDs for all documents waiting to be pushed.
This is a snapshot and may have changed by the time the response is received and processed.

<.> {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} returns `true` if the document is waiting to be pushed, and `false` otherwise.

[#lbl-nwk-errs]
== Error Handling

When _replicator_ detects a network error it updates its status depending on the error type (permanent or temporary) and returns an appropriate HTTP error code.

The following code snippet adds a `Change Listener`, which monitors a replication for errors and logs the the returned error code.

.Monitoring for network errors
====
[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=replication-error-handling,indent=0]
----
====

*For permanent network errors* (for example, `404` not found, or `401` unauthorized):
_Replicator_ will stop permanently, whether `setContinuous`  is _true_ or _false_. Of course, it sets its status to `STOPPED`

*For recoverable or temporary errors:* _Replicator_ sets its status to `OFFLINE`, then:

* If `setContinuous=_true_` it retries the connection indefinitely
* If `setContinuous=_false_` (one-shot) it retries the connection a limited number of times.

The following error codes are considered temporary by the Couchbase Lite replicator and thus will trigger a connection retry.

* `408`: Request Timeout
* `429`: Too Many Requests
* `500`: Internal Server Error
* `502`: Bad Gateway
* `503`: Service Unavailable
* `504`: Gateway Timeout
* `1001`: DNS resolution error


== Load Balancers

Couchbase Lite footnote:[From 2.0] uses WebSockets as the communication protocol to transmit data.
Some load balancers are not configured for WebSocket connections by default (NGINX for example);
so it might be necessary to explicitly enable them in the load balancer's configuration (see xref:sync-gateway::load-balancer.adoc[Load Balancers]).

By default, the WebSocket protocol uses compression to optimize for speed and bandwidth utilization.
The level of compression is set on Sync Gateway and can be tuned in the configuration file (xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:refer/config-properties.adoc#replicator_compression[`replicator_compression`]).

// === Replicator Notifications on a Custom Executor

[#lbl-cert-pinning]
== Certificate Pinning

Couchbase Lite for {param-title} supports certificate pinning.

Certificate pinning is a technique that can be used by applications to "pin" a host to its certificate.
The certificate is typically delivered to the client by an out-of-band channel and bundled with the client.
In this case, Couchbase Lite uses this embedded certificate to verify the trustworthiness of the server (for example, a Sync Gateway) and no longer needs to rely on a trusted third party for that (commonly referred to as the Certificate Authority).

The following steps describe how to configure certificate pinning between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway.

. xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#creating-your-own-self-signed-certificate[Create your own self-signed certificate] with the `openssl` command.
After completing this step, you should have 3 files: `cert.pem`, `cert.cer` and `privkey.pem`.
. xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#installing-the-certificate[Configure Sync Gateway] with the `cert.pem` and `privkey.pem` files.
After completing this step, Sync Gateway is reachable over `https`/`wss`.
. On the Couchbase Lite side, the replication must point to a URL with the `wss` scheme and configured with the `cert.cer` file created in step 1.
+
[#ex-crt-pinning]
====
This example loads the certificate from the application sandbox, then converts it to the appropriate type to configure the replication object.
[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tag=certificate-pinning,indent=0]

====
. Build and run your app.
The replication should now run successfully over https/wss with certificate pinning.
