== Introduction
This content provides code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over websockets.

Specifically it covers the implementation of a {glos-term-passive-peer}.
This _listener_ will accept a connection from an {glos-term-active-peer} and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both databases into sync.

In this context the _passive peer_ (listener) acts as the _server_ and the
 _active peer_ (replicator) acts as the _client_.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

== Configuration Summary
You should initialize and configure a Listener for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to to sync.
<<simple-listener-initialization>> shows a simple initialization and configuration process.

[#simple-listener-initialization]
.Listener configuration and initialization
====

----

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
TIP: You must include the initializer `CouchbaseLite.init(context)` such that it is executed once and once only prior to initializing the replicator; for example in your app's `onCreate()` method.
endif::[]

<.> Identify the local database to be used -- see: <<initialize-the-listener-configuration>>
<.> Optionally, choose a port to use.
By default the system will automatically assign a port -- to over-ride this see: <<set-network-and-port>>
<.> Optionally, choose a network-interface to use. By default the system will listen on all network interfaces -- to over-ride this see: <<set-network-and-port>>
<.> Optionally, choose to sync only changes, the default is not to enabld edelta-sync -- see: <<delta-sync>>.
<.> Set server security.
TLS is always enabled out-of-the-box, so you can usually omit this line.
But you _can_, optionally, disable TLS (*not* advisable in production) -- see: <<tls-security>>
<.> Optionally, apply the default TLS authentication, which is by anonymous self-signed certificate.
<.> Set client security.
Optionally, apply basic authentication to validate the user's presented credentials (`thisUser` and `thisPassword`), where `username` and `password` are the valid credentials -- see <<authenticating-the-client>> for more options.
<.> Initialize the listener using the configuration settings.
// Once initialized you cannot change the settings.
<.> <<start-listener>>
====

== API References
You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure active peers to connect to those.

Prior to initiating the listener you may execute a peer discovery phase.

// For the passive peer, this involves advertising the service using, for example _Bonjour_, and waiting for an invite from the active peer.
For the passive peer, this involves advertising the service using, for example
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
_Network Service Discovery_ (see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd)
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-ios}"]
_Bonjour_ (see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/)
endif::[]
 and waiting for an invite from the active peer.

The connection is established once the passive peer has authenticated and accepted an active peer's invitation.

// = Configure Listener

== Initialize the Listener Configuration
Initialize the Listener config with the local database.
All other configuration values will take their default setting.

Each Listener instance serves one Couchbase Lite database.
Couchbase sets no hard limit on the number of listeners you can initialize.

.Specify Local Database
====
In this example `thisDB` has previously been declared as an object of type Database.
[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-db, indent=0]

----

<.> Set the local database name using the {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s constructor {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-initdb}.
//`public init(database: Database)` {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-database} .

====


== Set Network and Port


Port number::
+
--

The Listener will automatically select an available port.

.Specify a Port to Use
====
[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-port, indent=0]
----

<.> To use a canonical port -- one known to other applications - specify it explicitly using the {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port} method shown here.
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
You can query the port using {}url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port-get.
endif::[]

Network Interface::
+
--
The Listener will listen on all network interfaces by default.

//== Configure the Listener

// <<configure-tls>>
// | <<configure-authenticating-the-client>>
// | <<configure-delta-sync>>
// | <<conflict-resolution>>
== Delta Sync

Delta Sync allows clients to sync only those parts of a document that have changed.
This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements.
Both valuable benefits, especially when network bandwidth is constrained.

.Enable delta sync
====
[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-delta-sync, indent=0]

----

<.> Delta sync replication is not enabled by default.
Use {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-delta-sync} method to activate or deactivate it.

== TLS Security
// DONE: TODO: Move under top level security section
// _In this section_:
// <<enable-or-disable-tls,Use TLS>>
// | <<configure-tls-server-identity, Set the TLS Identity>>
// | back to: <<simple-listener-initialization>>
TLS based encryption is enabled by default and this setting ought to be used in any production environment. However, it _can_ be disabled, for example for development and-or test environments.

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
[NOTE]
--
include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tags=android-manifest-cleartext]
--
endif::[]

The `disableTLS` setting must be 'false' when _Client Cert Authentication_ is required.
Basic Authentication can be used with, or without, TLS.

When TLS is enabled, Couchbase Lite provides several options on how the Listener may be configured with an appropriate TLS Identity (<<configure-tls-identity-for-listener>>).

Enable or Disable TLS::

NOTE: Typically, you will configure the Listener's TLS Identity once during initial launch.
Subsequent starts of the Listener will then reuse the identity from secure storage.

=====

== Authenticating the Client
In this section: <<use-basic-authentication>>  |  <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>  |  <<delete-tls-identity>>  |  <<the-impact-of-tls-settings>>

Use the
{url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration} class's {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-auth} method to specify how client credentials are to be authenticated.

Valid options are:
* No authentication -- If you do not define an Authenticator then all clients are accepted.
* {url-api-class-ListenerPasswordAuthenticator} -- which authenticates using a client's username and password.
* {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator} -- which authenticates using a client's certificate.

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-auth]

=== Use Basic Authentication
// === Authenticate Using the Client Username and Password

This section shows how to authenticate client username and password using basic authentication.
For how to authenticate using client certificates see: <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>

include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticator]

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticatorDelegate]

.Password authentication
====
// In this example, `allowlistedUsers` is a dictionary comprising the usernames and passwords of valid users. Credentials not in `allowlistedUsers` are denied access.

----
<.> Where 'thisUser' and 'thisPassword' are the client-suplied values to be authenticated.
====
// include::{snippet}[tags=listener-config-client-auth-pwd-full, indent=0]

=== Using Client Certificate Authentication

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerCertificateAuthenticator]
There are three ways to authenticate a client:

* A chain of one or more certificates that ends at a system CA signed certificate.
+
This is the default when no authenticator is specified
* A chain of one or more certificates that ends at a certificate in the list of certificates supplied to the constructor for `ListenerCertificateAuthenticator`.
+
Note that system CA certificates are ignored
* Application logic: This method assumes complete responsibility for verifying and authenticating the client.
+
If the second parameter supplied to the constructor for `ListenerCertificateAuthenticator` is non-null, all other forms of authentication are bypassed.
+
The client response to the certificate request is passed to the method supplied as the second constructor parameter.
The logic should take the form of function or block (such as, a closure expression) where the platform allows.

=== The Impact of TLS Settings

The table in this section shows the expected system behavior (in regards to security ) depending on the TLS configuration settings deployed.

.Expected system behavior
[cols="12,44,44"]
|===
|disableTLS |tlsIdentity (corresponding to server) |Expected system behavior

|true
|Ignored
a|TLS is disabled; all communication is plain text.

|false
| set to `nil`
a|* The system will auto generate an _anonymous_ self signed cert.
* Active peers (clients) should be configured to accept self-signed certificates.
* Communication is encrypted

|false
a|Set to server identity generated from a self- or CA-signed certificate

// On first use::
* On first use -- Bring your own certificate and private key; for example, using the {url-api-class-tlsidentity} class's {url-api-method-tls-identity-create} method to add it to the {securestorage}.
* Each time -- Use the server identity from the certificate stored in the {securestorage}; for example, using the {url-api-class-tlsidentity} class's {url-api-method-tls-identity-get} method with the alias you want to retrieve..

// See: {xref-cbl-pg-p2p-manage-tls-id} for more on how to store and use identities.

a|* System will use the configured identity.
* Active peers will validate the server certificate corresponding to the TLSIdentity (as long as they are configured to not skip validation -- see <<tls-security>>).

// |false
// a|
// // Use the convenience `createIdentity` API to generate the certificate and identity
// * On first use -- Bring your own CA certificate and private key (use `importIdentity`).
// * Each time -- Use the server identity from the CA certificate stored in the keychain; for example, use `TSLIdentity.identity(withIdentity:)`.

// See: {xref-cbl-pg-p2p-manage-tls-id} for more on how to store and use identities.

== Monitor Listener

Use the Listener's `getStatus` method to get counts of total and active connections -- see: <<get-connection-counts>>.

You should note that these counts can be extremely volatile. So, the actual number of active connections may have changed, by the time the call to, for example, `getActiveConnectionCount` returns a result.
