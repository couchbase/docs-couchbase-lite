== Introduction
This content provides code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over WebSockets.
Specifically, it covers the implementation of a {glos-term-passive-peer}.

Couchbase's Passive Peer (also referred to as the server, or Listener) will accept a connection from an {glos-term-active-peer} (also referred to as the client or replicator) and replicate database changes to synchronize both databases.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

include::ROOT:partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=securestorage]


== Configuration Summary

You should configure and initialize a Listener for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to sync.
There is no limit on the number of Listeners you may configure -- <<simple-listener-initialization>> shows a simple initialization and configuration process.


ifdef::is-android[]
TIP: You must include the initializer `CouchbaseLite.init(context)` such that it is executed (once only) before initializing the replicator; for example, in your app's `onCreate()` method.
endif::is-android[]

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="jvm"]
TIP: You must include the initializer `CouchbaseLite.init(context)` such that it is executed (once only) before initializing the replicator; for example, in your app's `onCreate()` method.

endif::[]

// Example 1
.Listener configuration and initialization
[#simple-listener-initialization]
:param-tags: listener-initialize
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

<.> Identify the local database to be used -- see: <<initialize-the-listener-configuration>>

<.> Optionally, choose a port to use.
By default the system will automatically assign a port -- to over-ride this, see: <<lbl-set-network-and-port>>

<.> Optionally, choose a network interface to use.
By default the system will listen on all network interfaces -- to over-ride this see: <<lbl-set-network-and-port>>

<.> Optionally, choose to sync only changes. 
The default is not to enable delta-sync -- see: <<delta-sync>>.

<.> Set server security.
TLS is always enabled instantly, so you can usually omit this line.
But you _can_, optionally, disable TLS (*not* advisable in production) -- see: <<lbl-tls-security>>

<.> Set the credentials this server will present to the client for authentication.
Here we show the default TLS authentication, which is an anonymous self-signed certificate.
The server must always authenticate itself to the client.

<.> Set client security -- define the credentials the server expects the client to present for authentication.
Here we show how basic authentication is configured to authenticate the client-supplied credentials from the http authentication header against valid credentials -- see <<lbl-authenticating-the-client>> for more options. +
Note that client authentication is optional.

<.> Initialize the listener using the configuration settings.

<.> <<lbl-start-listener>>

include::{module-partials}block_callouts.adoc[tags=listener-initialize]


== API References
You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the Listener is initialized on a well-known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well-known DNS address) then you can configure Active Peers to connect to those.

Before initiating the Listener, you may execute a peer discovery phase.
For the Passive Peer, this involves advertising the service using, for example,
ifdef::is-android[]
_Network Service Discovery_ (see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd)
endif::[]
ifdef::is-ios[]
_Bonjour_ (see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/)
endif::[]
 and waiting for an invite from the Active Peer.
The connection is established once the Passive Peer has authenticated and accepted an Active Peer's invitation.


== Initialize the Listener Configuration
Initialize the Listener configuration with the local database -- see <<ex-locdb>>
All other configuration values take their default setting.

Each Listener instance serves one Couchbase Lite database.
Couchbase sets no hard limit on the number of Listeners you can initialize.

// Example 2
.Specify Local Database
[#ex-locdb]
:param-tags: listener-config-db
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> Set the local database using the {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s constructor {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-initdb}. +
The database must be opened before the Listener is started. +
`thisDB` has previously been declared as an object of type `Database`.

[#lbl-set-network-and-port]
== Set Port and Network Interface


=== Port number
The Listener will automatically select an available port if you do not specify one -- see <<ex-port>> for how to specify a port.

// Example 3
.Specify a port
[#ex-port]
:param-tags: listener-config-port
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> To use a canonical port -- one known to other applications -- specify it explicitly using the {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port} method shown here. +
Ensure that firewall rules do not block any port you do specify. +
ifdef::is-android[]
You can query the port using {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port-get}.
endif::[]


=== Network Interface
The Listener will listen on all network interfaces by default.

// Example 4

[#specify-a-network-interface-to-use]
.Specify a Network Interface to Use
:param-tags: listener-config-netw-iface
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> To specify an interface -- one known to other applications -- identify it explicitly, using the {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-netwk-iface} method shown here.
This must be either an IP Address or network interface name such as `en0`.

:param-include!:
ifeval::["{param-name}"=="swift"]
:param-include: true
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-name}"=="csharp"]
:param-include: true
endif::[]

ifdef::param-include[]
TIP: Where necessary, you can identify the available interfaces at runtime, using appropriate platform tools -- see <<get-network-interfaces>>.

[#get-network-interfaces]
.Identify available network interfaces
:param-tags: listener-get-network-interfaces
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

endif::param-include[]
:param-include!:


== Delta Sync

Delta Sync allows clients to sync only those parts of a document that have changed.
This can result in significant bandwidth consumption savings and throughput improvements.
Both are valuable benefits, especially when network bandwidth is constrained.

// Example 5
.Enable delta sync
:param-tags: listener-config-delta-sync
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> Delta sync replication is not enabled by default.
Use {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-delta-sync} method to activate or deactivate it.

[#lbl-tls-security]
== TLS Security


=== Enable or Disable TLS

Define whether the connection is to use TLS or clear text.

TLS-based encryption is enabled by default, and this setting ought to be used in any production environment.
However, it _can_ be disabled. For example, for development or test environments.

When TLS is enabled, Couchbase Lite provides several options on how the Listener may be configured with an appropriate TLS Identity -- see <<configure-tls-identity-for-listener>>.

ifdef::is-android[]

endif::[]

include::ROOT:partial$p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-disable-tls]


=== Configure TLS Identity for Listener

Define the credentials the server will present to the client for authentication.
Note that the server must always authenticate itself with the client -- see: {p2psync-websocket-using-active--authenticate-listener} for how the client deals with this.

include::ROOT:partial$p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-tls-id]

NOTE: Typically, you will configure the Listener's TLS Identity once during the initial launch and re-use it (from {securestorage} on any subsequent starts.

Here are some example code snippets showing:

ifndef::is-android[* Importing a TLS identity -- see: <<ex-import-tls-id>>]
* Setting TLS identity to expect self-signed certificate --  -- see: <<ex-create-tls-id>>
* Setting TLS identity to expect anonymous certificate -- see: <<ex-anon-tls-id>>

ifndef::is-android[]

:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
<.> Ensure TLS is used.
<.> Map the required certificate attributes, in this case the common name.
<.> Create the required TLS identity using the attributes.

<.> Configure the server to present the defined identity credentials when prompted.


.Use Anonymous Self-Signed Certificate
[#ex-anon-tls-id]
:param-tags: listener-config-tls-enable;listener-config-tls-id-anon
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example uses an _anonymous_ self signed certificate. +

include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]

:param-tags!:
<.> Ensure TLS is used. +
This is the default setting.
<.> Authenticate using an anonymous self-signed certificate. +
This is the default setting.

// Are we missing a section that shows how to use TLSIdentity.getIdentity.  It would be used to create an identity with a certificate signed by a Root CA, in important case.  It could also be used to get an existing self-signed cert (perhaps one created by CreateIdentity above)

// [#authenticating-the-client]
[#lbl-authenticating-the-client]
== Authenticating the Client
In this section: <<use-basic-authentication>>  |  <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>  |  <<delete-tls-identity>>  |  <<the-impact-of-tls-settings>>

Define how the server (Listener) will authenticate the client as one it is prepared to interact with.

Whilst client authentication is optional, Couchbase lite provides the necessary tools to implement it.
Use the
{url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration} class's {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-auth} method to specify how the client-supplied credentials are to be authenticated.

Valid options are:

* No authentication -- If you do not define an Authenticator then all clients are accepted.
* Basic Authentication -- uses the {url-api-class-ListenerPasswordAuthenticator} to authenticate the client using the client-supplied username and password (from the http authentication header).
* {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator} -- which authenticates the client using a client supplied chain of one or more certificates.
You should initialize the authenticator using one of the following constructors:
** A list of one or more root certificates -- the client supplied certificate must end at a certificate in this list if it is to be authenticated
** A block of code that assumes total responsibility for authentication -- it must return a boolean response (true for an authenticated client, or false for a failed authentication).

// include::ROOT:partial$p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-auth]

=== Use Basic Authentication
// === Authenticate Using the Client Username and Password

Define how to authenticate client-supplied username and password credentials.
To use client-supplied certificates instead -- see: <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>

include::ROOT:partial$p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticator]

// include::ROOT:partial$p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticatorDelegate]


// Example 7
.Password authentication
:param-tags: listener-config-client-auth-pwd
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

<.> Where 'username'/'password' are the client-supplied values (from the http-authentication header) and `validUser`/`validPassword` are the values acceptable to the server.


=== Using Client Certificate Authentication
Define how the server will authenticate client-supplied certificates.

There are two ways to authenticate a client:

* A chain of one or more certificates that ends at a certificate in the list of certificates supplied to the constructor for  {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator} -- see: <<ex-set-cert-auth>>

* Application logic: This method assumes complete responsibility for verifying and authenticating the client -- see: <<ex-use-app-logic>>
+
If the parameter supplied to the constructor for `ListenerCertificateAuthenticator` is of type  `ListenerCertificateAuthenticatorDelegate`, all other forms of authentication are bypassed.
+
The client response to the certificate request is passed to the method supplied as the constructor parameter.
The logic should take the form of function or block (such as, a closure expression) where the platform allows.

// Example 8
.Set Certificate Authorization
[#ex-set-cert-auth]
:param-tags: listener-config-client-auth-root, indent=0]
:param-leader: pass:q,a[Configure the server (listener) to authenticate the client against a list of one or more certificates provided by the server to the the {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator}.]
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
<.>  Get the identity data to authenticate against.
This can be, for example, from a resource file provided with the app, or an identity previously saved in {securestorage}.
<.> Configure the authenticator to authenticate the client supplied certificate(s) using these root certs.
A valid client will provide one or more certificates that match a certificate in this list.
<.> Add the authenticator to the Listener configuration.


.Application Logic
[#ex-use-app-logic]
:param-tags: listener-config-client-auth-lambda
:param-leader: pass:q,a[Configure the server (listener) to authenticate the client using user-supplied logic.]
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
<.>  Get the identity data to authenticate against.
This can be, for example, from a resource file provided with the app, or an identity previously saved in {securestorage}.
<.>  Configure the Authenticator to pass the root certificates to a user supplied code block.
This code assumes complete responsibility for authenticating the client supplied certificate(s).
It must return a boolean value; with `true` denoting the client supplied certificate authentic.
<.> Add the authenticator to the Listener configuration.


[#delete-tls-identity]
=== Delete Entry

ifdef::is-android[]
You can remove unwanted entries from {securestorage} using the {securestorage-api} (see -- https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore#deleteEntry(java.lang.String)).
endif::[]
ifndef::is-android[]
You can remove unwanted TLS identities from {securestorage} using the convenience API.

=== The Impact of TLS Settings

The table in this section shows the expected system behavior (in regards to security) depending on the TLS configuration settings deployed.

:tlsIdNil: nil

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="net"]
:tlsIdNil: null
endif::[]

.Expected system behavior
[cols="12,44,44"]
|===
|disableTLS |tlsIdentity (corresponding to server) |Expected system behavior

|true
|Ignored
a|TLS is disabled; all communication is plain text.

|false
a| set to {tlsIdNil}
a|* The system will auto generate an _anonymous_ self signed cert.

// On first use::
* On first use -- Bring your own certificate and private key; for example, using the {url-api-class-tlsidentity} class's {url-api-method-tls-identity-create} method to add it to the {securestorage}.
* Each time -- Use the server identity from the certificate stored in the {securestorage}; for example, using the {url-api-class-tlsidentity} class's {url-api-method-tls-identity-get} method with the alias you want to retrieve..

[#lbl-start-listener]
== Start Listener

Once you have completed the Listener's configuration settings you can initialize the Listener instance and start it running -- see: <<initialize-and-start-listener>>

// Example 10
[#initialize-and-start-listener]
.Initialize and start listener
:param-tags: listener-start
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

include::{module-partials}block_callouts.adoc[tags=listener-start, indent=0]



== Monitor Listener

Use the Listener's `{url-api-property-urlendpointlistener-status}` property/method to get counts of total and active connections -- see: <<get-connection-counts>>.

You should note that these counts can be extremely volatile. So, the actual number of active connections may have changed, by the time the `{url-api-class-connection-status}` class returns a result.

// Example 11
.Get connection counts
[#get-connection-counts]
:param-tags: listener-status-check
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

// include::{exampleblock_callouts.adoc[tags=listener-status-check, indent=0]
include::{module-partials}block_callouts.adoc[tags=listener-status-check, indent=0]

== Stop Listener

It is best practice to check the status of the Listener's connections and stop only when you have confirmed that there are no active connections -- see <<get-connection-counts>>.

// Example 12
.Stop listener using `stop` method
:param-tags: listener-stop
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

NOTE: Closing the database will also close the Listener.
