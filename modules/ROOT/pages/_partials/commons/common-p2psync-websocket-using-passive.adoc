== Introduction
This content provides code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over websockets.
Specifically it covers the implementation of a {glos-term-passive-peer}.

This _passive peer_ (also referred to as the server, or listener) will accept a connection from an {glos-term-active-peer} (also referred to as the client or replicator) and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both databases into sync.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tags=securestorage]

== Configuration Summary
You should configure and initialize a listener for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to to sync.
There is no limit on the number of listeners you may configure -- <<simple-listener-initialization>> shows a simple initialization and configuration process.

// Example 1
// include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags="listener-initialize;!listener-local-db;!listener-config-tls-disable;!listener-config-tls-id-caCert;!listener-config-tls-id-SelfSigned;!listener-config-tls-id-set;!listener-config-client-auth-root;!listener-config-client-auth-lambda", indent=0]

.Listener configuration and initialization
====

[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-initialize, indent=0]

----

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
TIP: You must include the initializer `CouchbaseLite.init(context)` such that it is executed once and once only prior to initializing the replicator; for example in your app's `onCreate()` method.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-jvm}"]
TIP: You must include the initializer `CouchbaseLite.init(context)` such that it is executed once and once only prior to initializing the replicator; for example in your app's `onCreate()` method.

endif::[]

*Notes on example:*

<.> Identify the local database to be used -- see: <<initialize-the-listener-configuration>>
<.> Optionally, choose a port to use.
By default the system will automatically assign a port -- to over-ride this see: <<set-network-and-port>>
<.> Optionally, choose a network-interface to use. By default the system will listen on all network interfaces -- to over-ride this see: <<set-network-and-port>>
<.> Optionally, choose to sync only changes, the default is not to enable delta-sync -- see: <<delta-sync>>.
<.> Set server security.
TLS is always enabled out-of-the-box, so you can usually omit this line.
But you _can_, optionally, disable TLS (*not* advisable in production) -- see: <<tls-security>>
<.> Set the credentials this server will present to the client for authentication.
Here we show the default TLS authentication, which is by anonymous self-signed certificate.
The server must always authenticate itself to the client.
<.> Set client security -- define the credentials the server expects the client to present for authentication.
Here we show how basic authentication is configured to authenticate the client-supplied credentials from the http authentication header against valid credentials -- see <<authenticating-the-client>> for more options.
+
Note that client authentication is optional.
<.> Initialize the listener using the configuration settings.
// Once initialized you cannot change the settings.
<.> <<start-listener>>
// include any module specific items

== API References
You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure active peers to connect to those.

Prior to initiating the listener you may execute a peer discovery phase.

// For the passive peer, this involves advertising the service using, for example _Bonjour_, and waiting for an invite from the active peer.
For the passive peer, this involves advertising the service using, for example
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
_Network Service Discovery_ (see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd)
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-ios}"]
_Bonjour_ (see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/)
endif::[]
 and waiting for an invite from the active peer.

The connection is established once the passive peer has authenticated and accepted an active peer's invitation.

// = Configure Listener

== Initialize the Listener Configuration
Initialize the listener configuration with the local database.
All other configuration values take their default setting.

Each Listener instance serves one Couchbase Lite database.
Couchbase sets no hard limit on the number of listeners you can initialize.

// Example 2
.Specify Local Database
====
In this example `thisDB` has previously been declared as an object of type Database.
[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-db, indent=0]

----

*Notes on example:*

<.> Set the local database name using the {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s constructor {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-initdb}.
+
The database must be opened before the listener is started.
//`public init(database: Database)` {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-database} .

====


== Set Network and Port


Port number::
+
--

The Listener will automatically select an available port if you do not specify one.

// Example 3
.Specify a Port to Use
====
[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-port, indent=0]
----

*Notes on example:*

<.> To use a canonical port -- one known to other applications -- specify it explicitly using the {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port} method shown here.
Ensure that any port you do specify is not blocked by firewall rules.
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
You can query the port using {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-port-get}.
endif::[]
--

Network Interface::
+
--
The Listener will listen on all network interfaces by default.

// Example 4
.Specify a Network Interface to Use
====
[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-netw-iface, indent=0]
----

*Notes on example:*

<.> To specify an interface -- one known to other applications -- identify it explicitly, using the {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-netwk-iface} method shown here.
This must be either an IP Address or network interface name such as `en0`.
====
--

You can identify the listener's available URLs using {url-api-property-urlendpointlistener-urls}

.Get listener URL list

//== Configure the Listener

// <<configure-tls>>
// | <<configure-authenticating-the-client>>
// | <<configure-delta-sync>>
// | <<conflict-resolution>>
== Delta Sync

Delta Sync allows clients to sync only those parts of a document that have changed.
This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements.
Both valuable benefits, especially when network bandwidth is constrained.

// Example 5
.Enable delta sync
====
[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-delta-sync, indent=0]

----

*Notes on example:*

<.> Delta sync replication is not enabled by default.
Use {url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration}'s {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-delta-sync} method to activate or deactivate it.

// | back to: <<simple-listener-initialization>>


=== Enable or Disable TLS
Define whether the connection is to use TLS or clear text.

TLS based encryption is enabled by default and this setting ought to be used in any production environment. However, it _can_ be disabled, for example for development and-or test environments.

When TLS is enabled, Couchbase Lite provides several options on how the Listener may be configured with an appropriate TLS Identity -- see <<configure-tls-identity-for-listener>>.

include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-disable-tls]

=== Configure TLS Identity for Listener

Define the credentials the server will present to the client for authentication. Note that the server must always authenticate itself with the client -- for how the client deals with this, see {xref-cbl-bmk-dbo-p2psync-websocket-using-active-auth-listener}.

include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-tls-id]

NOTE: Typically, you will configure the listener's TLS Identity once during initial launch and re-use it (from {securestorage} on any subsequent starts.

Use Anonymous Self-Signed Certificate::
+
--
This examples uses an “anonymous” self signed certificate.
Generated certificates are held in {securestorage}.

<.> These are are the default settings. Authentication using an anonymous self-signed certificate is assumed.
--
// Are we missing a section that shows how to use TLSIdentity.getIdentity.  It would be used to create an identity with a certificate signed by a Root CA, in important case.  It could also be used to get an existing self-signed cert (perhaps one created by CreateIdentity above)

=====

== Authenticating the Client
In this section: <<use-basic-authentication>>  |  <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>  |  <<delete-tls-identity>>  |  <<the-impact-of-tls-settings>>

Define how the server (listener) will authenticate the client as one it is prepared to interact with.

Whilst client authentication is optional, Couchbase lite provides the necessary tools to implement it. Use the
{url-api-class-urlendpointconfiguration} class's {url-api-references-urlendpointconfiguration-auth} method to specify how the client-supplied credentials are to be authenticated.

Valid options are:

* No authentication -- If you do not define an Authenticator then all clients are accepted.
* Basic Authentication -- uses the {url-api-class-ListenerPasswordAuthenticator} to authenticate the client using the client-supplied username and password (from the http authentication header).
* {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator} -- which authenticates the client using a client supplied chain of one or more certificates.
You should initialize the authenticator using one of the following constructors:
** A list of one or more root certificates -- the client supplied certificate must end at a certificate in this list if it is to be authenticated
** A block of code that assumes total responsibility for authentication -- it must return a boolean response (true for an authenticated client, or false for a failed authentication).

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=config-auth]

=== Use Basic Authentication
// === Authenticate Using the Client Username and Password

Define how to authenticate client-supplied username and password credentials.
To use client-supplied certificates instead -- see: <<using-client-certificate-authentication>>

include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticator]

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerPasswordAuthenticatorDelegate]


// Example 7
.Password authentication
====
// In this example, `allowlistedUsers` is a dictionary comprising the usernames and passwords of valid users. Credentials not in `allowlistedUsers` are denied access.


[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=listener-config-client-auth-pwd, indent=0]

----

*Notes on example:*

<.> Where 'username'/'password' are the client-supplied values (from the http-authentication header) and `validUser`/`validPassword` are the values acceptable to the server.
====
// include::{snippet}[tags=listener-config-client-auth-pwd-full, indent=0]

=== Using Client Certificate Authentication
Define how the server will authenticate client-supplied certificates.

// include::{root-partials}p2p-api.adoc[tag=ListenerCertificateAuthenticator]
There are three ways to authenticate a client:

* A chain of one or more certificates that ends at a system CA signed certificate.
+
This is the default when no authenticator is specified
* A chain of one or more certificates that ends at a certificate in the list of certificates supplied to the constructor for  {url-api-class-ListenerCertificateAuthenticator}.
+
Note that system CA certificates are ignored
* Application logic: This method assumes complete responsibility for verifying and authenticating the client.
+
If the parameter supplied to the constructor for `ListenerCertificateAuthenticator` is of type  `ListenerCertificateAuthenticatorDelegate`, all other forms of authentication are bypassed.
+
The client response to the certificate request is passed to the method supplied as the constructor parameter.
The logic should take the form of function or block (such as, a closure expression) where the platform allows.

// Example 8
.Set Certificate Authorization

Root CA::

A valid client will provide one or more certificates that match a certificate in this list.

== Monitor Listener

Use the Listener's `{url-api-property-urlendpointlistener-status}` property/method to get counts of total and active connections -- see: <<get-connection-counts>>.

You should note that these counts can be extremely volatile. So, the actual number of active connections may have changed, by the time the `{url-api-class-connection-status}` class returns a result.
