=== Replication Status and App Life Cycle

// end::android[]

Couchbase Lite replications will continue running until the app terminates, unless the remote system, or the application, terminates the connection.

NOTE: Recall that the Android OS may kill an application without warning.
You should explicitly stop replication processes when they are no longer useful (for example, when they are `suspended` or `idle`) to avoid socket connections being closed by the OS, which may interfere with the replication process.

The following diagram describes the status changes when the application starts a replication, and when the application is being backgrounded or foregrounded by the OS.
It applies to iOS only.

Additionally, on iOS, an app already in the background may be terminated.
In this case, the `Database` and `Replicator` instances will be `null` when the app returns to the foreground.
Therefore, as preventive measure, it is recommended to do a `null` check when the app enters the foreground, and to re-initialize the database and replicator if any of those is `null`.

On other platforms, Couchbase Lite doesn't react to OS backgrounding or foregrounding events and replication(s) will continue running as long as the remote system does not terminate the connection and the app does not terminate.
It is generally recommended to stop replications before going into the background otherwise socket connections may be closed by the OS and this may interfere with the replication process.
