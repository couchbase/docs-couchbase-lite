== Introduction

Couchbase Lite for {param-title} provides two ways to build and run database queries; the QueryBuilder API described in this topic and {query-n1ql-mobile--xref}.

Database queries defined with the QueryBuilder API use the query statement format shown in <<ex-query-form>>.
The structure and semantics of the query format are based on Couchbase's xref:server:learn:data/n1ql-versus-sql.adoc[{sqlpp} query language].

[#ex-query-form]
.Query Format
====
[source, SQL, subs="+attributes, +macros"]
----
SELECT {blank-field} // 
FROM 'data source' // 
WHERE {blank-field}, // 
JOIN {blank-field} // 
GROUP BY {blank-field} // 
ORDER BY {blank-field} //

Query Components::
|====
| Component | Description

| <<lbl-select>> 
a| The document properties that will be returned in the result set 

| FROM 
a| The data source to query the documents from - the collection of the database.

 | <<lbl-where>> 
a| The query criteria +
The `SELECT`ed properties of documents matching this criteria will be returned in the result set

| <<lbl-join>> 
a| The criteria for joining multiple documents

| <<lbl-group>> 
a| The criteria used to group returned items in the result set

TIP: We recommend working through the query section of the {couchbase-tutorials--mobile-workshop--xref} tutorial as a good way to build your skills in this area.



[#lbl-select]
== SELECT statement

--
In this section::
<<lbl-return-properties>>{menuitem-delimiter} <<lbl-return-all>>
Related::
<<lbl-resultsets, Handling result sets>>
--

Use the `SELECT` statement to specify which properties you want to return from the queried documents.
You can opt to retrieve entire documents, or just the specific properties you need.

[#lbl-return-all]
=== Return All Properties
Use the `SelectResult.all()` method to return all the properties of selected documents -- see: <<ex-select-all>>.

.Using SELECT to Retrieve All Properties
[#ex-select-all]
:param-tags: query-select-all
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This query shows how to retrieve all properties from all documents in your database.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

The query.execute statement returns the results in a dictionary, where the key is the database name -- see <<ex-return-all>>.


[#ex-return-all]
.ResultSet Format from SelectResult.all()
====
[{json-snippet}]
----
include::{root-examples}query-snippets.adoc[tags=query-result-format-all]
----
<.> The result for the first document matching the query criteria.
<.> The result for the next document matching the query criteria.

====

See: <<lbl-resultsets>> for more on processing query results.


[#lbl-return-properties]
=== Return Selected Properties
To access only specific properties, specify a comma-separated list of `SelectResult` expressions, one for each property, in the select statement of your query  -- see: <<ex-select-properties>>

[#ex-select-properties]
.Using SELECT to Retrieve Specific Properties
:param-tags: query-select-props
:param-leader: pass:q,a[In this query we retrieve and then print the `_id`, `type` and `name` properties of each document.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

The `query.execute` statement returns one or more key-value pairs, one for each SelectResult expression, with the property-name as the key -- see <<ex-return-properties>>

[#ex-return-properties]
.Select Result Format
====
[{json-snippet}]
----

include::{root-examples}query-snippets.adoc[tags=query-result-format-props]

----
<.> The result for the first document matching the query criteria.
<.> The result for the next document matching the query criteria.

====

See: <<lbl-resultsets>> for more on processing query results.


[#lbl-where]
== WHERE statement

In this section::
<<lbl-comp-ops>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-coll-ops>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-like-ops>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-regex-ops>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-deleted-ops>>

Like SQL, you can use the `WHERE` statement to choose  which documents are returned by your query.
The select statement takes in an `Expression`.
You can chain any number of Expressions in order to implement sophisticated filtering capabilities.


[#lbl-comp-ops]
=== Comparison Operators
The {url-api-classes-query-expression-comparators} can be used in the WHERE statement to specify on which property to match documents.
In the example below, we use the `equalTo` operator to query documents where the `type` property equals "hotel".

[{json-snippet}]
----
include::{root-examples}query-snippets.adoc[tags=query-result-format-props]
----

.Using Where
:param-tags: query-where
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


[#lbl-coll-ops]
=== Collection Operators
{url-api-classes-query-arrayfunction-collection-ops} are useful to check if a given value is present in an array.


==== CONTAINS Operator
The following example uses the `{url-api-classes-query-arrayfunction}` to find documents where the `public_likes` array property contains a value equal to "Armani Langworth".

[{json-snippet}]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "name": "Apple Droid",
    "public_likes": ["Armani Langworth", "Elfrieda Gutkowski", "Maureen Ruecker"]
}
----

:param-tags: query-collection-operator-contains
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

==== IN Operator

The `IN` operator is useful when you need to explicitly list out the values to test against.
The following example looks for documents whose `first`, `last` or `username` property value equals "Armani".

:param-tags: query-collection-operator-in
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


[#lbl-like-ops]
=== Like Operator
In this section::
<<lbl-string-match>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-wild-match>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-wild-chars>>

[#lbl-string-match]
==== String Matching
The {url-api-method-expression-like} operator can be used for string matching -- see <<ex-like-case-insensitive>>

NOTE: The `like` operator performs **case sensitive** matches. +
To perform case insensitive matching, use `Function.lower` or `Function.upper` to ensure all comparators have the same case, thereby removing the case issue.

This query returns `landmark` type documents where the `name` matches the string "Royal Engineers Museum", regardless of how it is capitalized (so, it selects "royal engineers museum", "ROYAL ENGINEERS MUSEUM" and so on).

.Like with case-insensitive matching
[#ex-like-case-insensitive]
:param-tags: query-like-operator
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

*Note* the use of `Function.lower` to transform `name` values to the same case as the literal comparator.


[#lbl-wild-match]
==== Wildcard Match

We can use `%` sign within a `like` expression to do a wildcard match against zero or more characters.
Using wildcards allows you to have some fuzziness in your search string.

In <<ex-wldcd-match>> below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark" where the name property matches any string that begins with "eng" followed by zero or more characters, the letter "e", followed by zero or more characters.
Once again, we are using `Function.lower` to make the search case insensitive.

So "landmark" documents with names such as "Engineers", "engine", "english egg" and "England Eagle".
Notice that the matches may span word boundaries.

.Wildcard Matches
[#ex-wldcd-match]
:param-tags: query-like-operator-wildcard-match
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

[#lbl-wild-chars]
==== Wildcard Character Match

We can use an `_` sign within a like expression to do a wildcard match against a single character.

In <<ex-wldcd-char-match>> below, we are looking for documents of type "landmark" where the `name` property matches any string that begins with "eng" followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending in the letter "r".
The query returns "landmark" type documents with names such as "Engineer", "engineer" and so on.

.Wildcard Character Matching
[#ex-wldcd-char-match]
:param-tags: query-like-operator-wildcard-character-match
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


[#lbl-regex-ops]
=== Regex Operator

Similar to the wildcards in `like` expressions, `regex` based pattern matching allow you to introduce an element of fuzziness in your search string -- see the code shown in <<ex-regex>>.

NOTE: The `regex` operator is case sensitive, use `upper` or `lower` functions to mitigate this if required.

[#ex-regex]
.Using Regular Expressions
:param-tags: query-regex-operator,indent=0]
:param-leader: This example returns documents with a `type` of "landmark" and a `name` property that matches any string that begins with "eng" and ends in the letter "e".
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
<.> The `\b` specifies that the match must occur on word boundaries.

TIP: For more on the regex spec used by {cbl} see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/[cplusplus regex reference page^]

// ISNULLORMISSING / NOTNULLORMISING
// For the QueryBuilder API, isNullOrMissing and NotNullOrMissing operators will be deprecated and the isValued and isNotValued operators will be added.

[#lbl-deleted-ops]
=== Deleted Document
You can query documents that have been deleted (tombstones) {fn2x5} as shown in <<ex-del-qry>>.

.Query to select Deleted Documents
[#ex-del-qry]
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example shows how to query deleted documents in the database. It returns is an array of key-value pairs.]
:param-tags: query-deleted-documents
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


[#lbl-join]
== JOIN statement
The JOIN clause enables you to select data from multiple documents that have been linked by criteria specified in the JOIN statement.
For example to combine airline details with route details, linked by the airline id -- see <<ex-join>>.

.Using JOIN to Combine Document Details
[#ex-join]
:param-tags: query-join
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example JOINS the document of type `route` with documents of type `airline` using the document ID (`_id`) on the _airline_ document and `airlineid` on the _route_ document.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


[#lbl-group]
== GROUP BY statement
You can perform further processing on the data in your result set before the final projection is generated.

The following example looks for the number of airports at an altitude of 300 ft or higher and groups the results by country and timezone.

.Data Model for Example
[{json-snippet}]
----
{
    "_id": "airport123",
    "type": "airport",
    "country": "United States",
    "geo": { "alt": 456 },
    "tz": "America/Anchorage"
}
----

[#ex-grpby-qry]
.Query using GroupBy
:param-tags: query-groupby
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example shows a query that selects all airports with an altitude above 300ft. The output (a count, $1) is grouped by country, within timezone.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


The query shown in <<ex-grpby-qry>> generates the following output:
--
There are 138 airports on the Europe/Paris timezone located in France and above 300 ft +
There are 29 airports on the Europe/London timezone located in United Kingdom and above 300 ft +
There are 50 airports on the America/Anchorage timezone located in United States and above 300 ft +
There are 279 airports on the America/Chicago timezone located in United States and above 300 ft +
There are 123 airports on the America/Denver timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
--


[#lbl-order]
== ORDER BY statement

It is possible to sort the results of a query based on a given expression result -- see <<ex-orderby-qry>>

[#ex-orderby-qry]
.Query using OrderBy
:param-tags: query-orderby
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example shows a query that returns documents of type equal to "hotel" sorted in ascending order by the value of the title property.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

The query shown in <<ex-orderby-qry>> generates the following output:
[{text-snippet}]
----
Aberdyfi
Achiltibuie
Altrincham
Ambleside
Annan
Ardèche
Armagh
Avignon
----


[#lbl-date-time]
== Date/Time Functions


Couchbase Lite documents support a <<initializers,date type>> that internally stores dates in ISO 8601 with the GMT/UTC timezone.

Couchbase Lite's Query Builder API
ifdef::fnref_2x5[{fnref_2x5}]
includes four functions for date comparisons.

`Function.StringToMillis(Expression.Property("date_time"))`::
The input to this will be a validly formatted ISO 8601 `date_time` string.
The end result will be an expression (with a numeric content) that can be further input into the query builder.
`Function.StringToUTC(Expression.Property("date_time"))`::
The input to this will be a validly formatted ISO 8601 `date_time` string.
The end result will be an expression (with string content) that can be further input into the query builder.
`Function.MillisToString(Expression.Property("date_time"))`::
The input for this is a numeric value representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
The end result will be an expression (with string content representing the date and time as an ISO 8601 string in the device’s timezone) that can be further input into the query builder.
`Function.MillisToUTC(Expression.Property("date_time"))`::
The input for this is a numeric value representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
The end result will be an expression (with string content representing the date and time as a UTC ISO 8601 string) that can be further input into the query builder.


[#lbl-resultsets]
== Result Sets
In this section::
<<lbl-process-resultset>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-all-sel>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-specific-sel>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-id-sel>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-count-sel>>{menuitem-delimiter}
<<lbl-pagination>>


[#lbl-process-resultset]
=== Processing

This section shows how to handle the returned result sets for different types of `SELECT` statements.

The result set format and its handling varies slightly depending on the type of SelectResult statements used.
The result set formats you may encounter include those generated by :

* SelectResult.all -- see: <<lbl-all-sel, All Properties>>
* SelectResult.expression(property("name")) -- see: <<lbl-specific-sel, Specific Properties>>
* SelectResult.expression(meta.id) --  Metadata (such as the `_id`) -- see: <<lbl-id-sel, Document ID Only>>
* SelectResult.expression(Function.count(Expression.all())).as("mycount") --  see: <<lbl-count-sel>>

To process the results of a query, you first need to execute it using `Query.execute`.

The execution of a Couchbase Lite for {param-title}'s database query typically returns an array of results, a result set.

* The result set of an aggregate, count-only, query is a key-value pair -- see <<lbl-count-sel>> -- which you can access using the count name as its key.

* The result set of a query returning document properties is an array. +
Each array row represents the data from a document that matched your search criteria (the `WHERE` statements)
The composition of each row is determined by the combination of `SelectResult` expressions provided in the `SELECT` statement.
To unpack these result sets you need to iterate this array.


[#lbl-all-sel]
=== Select All Properties

==== Query
The `Select` statement for this type of query, returns all document properties for each document matching the query criteria -- see <<ex-all-qry>>

.Query selecting All Properties
[#ex-all-qry]
:param-tags: query-syntax-all
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

==== Result Set Format
The result set returned by queries using `SelectResult.all` is an array of dictionary objects -- one for each document matching the query criteria.

For each result object, the key is the database name and the 'value' is a dictionary representing each document property as a key-value pair -- see: <<ex-all-rtn>>.

.Format of Result Set (All Properties)
[#ex-all-rtn]

[#lbl-id-sel]
=== Select Document Id Only

==== Query
You would typically use this type of query if retrieval of document properties directly would consume excessive amounts of memory and-or processing time -- see: <<ex-id-qry>>.

.Query selecting only Doc Id
[#ex-id-qry]
:param-tags: query-syntax-id
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


==== Result Set Format
The result set returned by queries using a SelectResult expression of the form `SelectResult.expression(meta.id)` is an array of dictionary objects -- one for each document matching the query criteria.
Each result object has `id` as the key and the ID value as its value -- -see <<ex-id-rtn>>.

.Format of Result Set (Doc Id only)
[#ex-id-rtn]
====
[{json-snippet}]

:param-tags: query-access-count-only
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> Get the count using the `SelectResult.as` alias, which is used as its key.

[#lbl-pagination]
=== Handling Pagination
One way to handle pagination in high-volume queries is to retrieve the results in batches.
Use the `limit` and `offset` feature, to return a defined number of results starting from a given offset -- see: <<ex-pagination>>.


[#ex-pagination]
.Query Pagination
:param-tags: query-syntax-pagination
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]

== JSON Result Sets

Couchbase Lite for {param-title} provides a convenience API to convert query results to JSON strings.

include::{root-commons}querybuilder-jsonresult.adoc[subs="macros,attributes"]


[#lbl-predquery]
== Predictive Query

.Enterprise Edition only
IMPORTANT: Predictive Query is an https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Enterprise Edition] feature.

Predictive Query enables Couchbase Lite queries to use machine learning, by providing query functions that can process document data (properties or blobs) via trained ML models.

Let's consider an image classifier model that takes a picture as input and outputs a label and probability.

image::ROOT:predictive-diagram.png[]

To run a predictive query with a model as the one shown above, you must implement the following steps.

. <<integrate-the-model,Integrate the Model>>
. <<register-the-model,Register the Model>>
. <<create-an-index,Create an Index (Optional)>>
. <<run-a-prediction-query,Run a Prediction Query>>
. <<Deregister-the-model,Deregister the Model>>


=== Integrate the Model

To integrate a model with Couchbase Lite, you must implement the `PredictiveModel` interface which has only one function called `predict()` -- see: <<int-pred-model>>.

.Integrating a predictive model
[#int-pred-model]
:param-tags: predictive-model
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<1> The `predict(input) ++->++ output` method provides the input and expects the result of using the machine learning model.
The input and output of the predictive model is a `DictionaryObject`.
Therefore, the supported data type will be constrained by the data type that the `DictionaryObject` supports.


=== Register the Model

To register the model you must create a new instance and pass it to the `Database.prediction.registerModel` static method.

.Registering a predictive model
[#reg-pred-model]
:param-tags: register-model
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


=== Create an Index

Creating an index for a predictive query is highly recommended.
By computing the predictions during writes and building a prediction index, you can significantly improve the speed of prediction queries (which would otherwise have to be computed during reads).

There are two types of indexes for predictive queries:

* <<value-index,Value Index>>
* <<predictive-index,Predictive Index>>

==== Value Index

The code below creates a value index from the "label" value of the prediction result.
When documents are added or updated, the index will call the prediction function to update the label value in the index.

.Creating a value index
[#crt-val-index]
:param-tags: predictive-query-value-index
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


==== Predictive Index

Predictive Index is a new index type used for predictive query.
It differs from the value index in that it caches the predictive results and creates a value index from that cache when the predictive results values are specified.

.Creating a predictive index
[#crt-val-index]
:param-tags: predictive-query-predictive-index
:param-leader: pass:q,a[Here we create a predictive index from the `label` value of the prediction result.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


=== Run a Prediction Query

The code below creates a query that calls the prediction function to return the "label" value for the first 10 results in the database.

.Creating a value index
[#crt-val-index]
:param-tags: predictive-query
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<1> The `PredictiveModel.predict()` method returns a constructed Prediction Function object which can be used further to specify a property value extracted from the output dictionary of the `PredictiveModel.predict()` function.
+
NOTE: The null value returned by the prediction method will be interpreted as MISSING value in queries.


=== Deregister the Model

To deregister the model you must call the `Database.prediction.unregisterModel` static method.

.Deregister a value index
[#dereg-val-index]
:param-tags: unregister-model
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]

=== Integrate a Model with CoreMLPredictiveModel

NOTE: iOS Only

`CoreMLPredictiveModel` is a Core ML based implementation of the `PredictiveModel` protocol that facilitates the integration of Core ML models with Couchbase Lite.

The following example describes how to load a Core ML model using `CoreMLPredictiveModel`.
All other steps (register, indexing, query, unregister) are the same as with a model that is integrated using your own `PredictiveModel` implementation.
