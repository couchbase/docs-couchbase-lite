// == Certificate Pinning
Couchbase Lite supports certificate pinning.
Certificate pinning is a technique that can be used by applications to "pin" a host to its certificate.
The certificate is typically delivered to the client by an out-of-band channel and bundled with the client.
In this case, Couchbase Lite uses this embedded certificate to verify the trustworthiness of the server and no longer needs to rely on a trusted third party for that (commonly referred to as the Certificate Authority).

The following steps describe how to configure certificate pinning between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway.

. xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#creating-your-own-self-signed-certificate[Create your own self-signed certificate] with the `openssl` command.
After completing this step, you should have 3 files: `cert.pem`, `cert.cer` and `privkey.pem`.
. xref:sync-gateway::security.adoc#installing-the-certificate[Configure Sync Gateway] with the `cert.pem` and `privkey.pem` files.
After completing this step, Sync Gateway is reachable over `https`/`wss`.
. On the Couchbase Lite side, the replication must point to a URL with the `wss` scheme and configured with the `cert.cer` file created in step 1.

This example loads the certificate from the application sandbox, then converts it to the appropriate type to configure the replication object.
. Build and run your app.
The replication should now run successfully over https with certificate pinning.

=== Troubleshooting

If Sync Gateway is configured with a self signed certificate but your app points to a `ws` scheme instead of `wss` you will encounter an error with status code `11006`.

CouchbaseLite Replicator ERROR: {Repl#2} Got LiteCore error: WebSocket error 1006 "connection closed abnormally"

If Sync Gateway is configured with a self signed certificate, and your app points to a `wss` scheme but the replicator configuration isn't using the certificate you will encounter an error with status code `5011`.
