DOC-6340-H2-P2P: New topic - Implementing P2P Sync
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-6340
This is the main P2P content covering Couchbase Lite P2P:

Create a parent topic P2P Sync that will cover the generic sync concepts and then branch to cover new URLEndpointListener topic, existing EndpointListener topic

.Enterprise Edition only
IMPORTANT: Peer-to-peer sync is an https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Enterprise Edition] feature.
You must purchase the Enterprise License which includes official https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy[Couchbase Support] to use it in production (also see the https://www.couchbase.com/licensing-and-support-faq[FAQ]).



// For offline-first applications requiring direct collaboration between the edge devices,
== Introduction
Couchbase Lite's peer-to-peer sync solution offers secure storage and bidirectional synchronization of data between edge devices without the need for a centralized cloud-based control point.

The solution provides “out-of-box” peer-to-peer support in IP-based networks, which enables customers to:

* Simplify development by enabling sync with just a few lines of code
* Optimize network bandwidth usage and reduce data transfer cost with Delta Sync support
* Securely sync data with built-in support for TLS encryption and authentication support
* Significantly reduce complexity of managing document conflicts from concurrent writes with built-in conflict resolution support.


== Replication Characteristics

Replications take place over secure encrypted websocket connections (SSL/TLS).

The replication provides built-in network resiliency allowing sync between heterogenous Couchbase lite platforms and flexible topologies.

Network connection errors are handled by persistent exponential backoff, with retries continuing indefinitely (or for a specified maximum period).

== Component Responsibilities


== Approach
{glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} enables edge devices running Couchbase Lite to directly sync Couchbase Lite database changes with each other without a server.

In peer-to-peer exchanges, Couchbase Lite is responsible for storing the data and keeping track of the data exchange.
The synchronization is handled by our peer-to-peer sync communication framework.

To sync, one of the Couchbase Lite instances must use a _URLEndpointListener_, enabling its database to become the remote in a standard replication by listening and exposing Couchbase's replication endpoints on a selected port.

// * A custom built _MessageEndpointListener_
// +
// Using this approach developers can use the platform APIs and-or a third party Communication Framework such as
// ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
// Android's https://developers.google.com/nearby/messages/overview[Nearby Messages API]
// endif::[]
// ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-ios}"]
// Apple’s https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity[Multipeer Connectivity Framework]
// endif::[]
// , to implement their own listener.
// +
// This provides great flexibility. It will handle sending and receiving messages and supports multiple transport technologies -- WiFi and Bluetooth and uses whichever is available to establish a connection between devices.

In Couchbase Lite, a peer can take on one of these two roles:

Active Peer::
The peer that initializes the connection and replication.
Passive Peer::
The passive side reacts to things that it receives but does not initiate any communication on its own.
