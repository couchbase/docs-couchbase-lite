== Introduction

{cbl} for {param-title} uses _blobs_ to store the contents of images, other media files and similar format files as binary objects.

The blob itself is not stored in the document.
It is held in a separate content-addressable store indexed from the document and retrieved only on-demand.

When a document is synchronized, the {cbl} replicator adds an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains a blob -- see <<img-blob>>.


== Blob Objects

The blob as an object appears in a document as dictionary property -- see, for example _avatar_ in <<img-blob>>.

Other properties include `length` (the length in bytes), and optionally `content_type` (typically, its MIME type).

The blob's data (an image, audio or video content) is not stored in the document, but in a separate content-addressable store, indexed by the `digest` property -- see <<lbl-using>>.


=== Constraints

* {cbl} +
Blobs can be arbitrarily large.
They are only read on demand, not when you load a the _document_.

* {sgw} +
The maximum content size is 20 MB per blob.
If a document's blob is over 20 MB, the document will be replicated but not the blob.

== Using Blobs

The `Blob` API lets you access the blob's data content as in-memory data (a `Data` object) or as an `InputStream`.

The code in <<ex-blob>> shows how you might add a blob to a document and save it to the database. Here we use `avatar` as the property key and a jpeg file as the blob data.

.Working with blobs
[#ex-blob]
:param-tags: blob

:param-tags!:
<.> Here we prepare a document to use for the example
<.> Create the blob using the retrieved image. +
 Here we set `image/jpg` as the blob MIME type.
<.> Add the blob to a document, using `avatar` as the property key +
Saving the document generates a random access key for each blob stored in `digest` a SHA-1 encrypted property -- see: <<img-blob>>. +
We can use the `avatar` key to retrieve the blob object later.
Note, this is the identity of the blob assigned by us; the replication auto-generates a blob for attachments and assigns its own name to it (for example, `blob_1`) -- see <<img-blob>>.
The `digest` key will be the same as generated when we saved the blob document.


== Syncing
When a document containing a blob object is synchronized, the {cbl} replicator generates an `_attachments` dictionary with an auto-generated name for each blob attachment.
This is different to the `avatar` key and is used internally to access the blob content.

If you view a sync'd blob document in {cbs} Admin Console, you will see something similar to <<img-blob>>, which shows the document with its generated `_attachments` dictionary, including the `digest`.
