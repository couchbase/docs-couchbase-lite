In this section::
<<lbl-repl-chng>>  |
<<lbl-repl-status>>  |
ifndef::is-p2p[<<lbl-repl-evnts>> |  ]
<<lbl-repl-pend>>

You can monitor a replicationâ€™s status by using a combination of <<lbl-repl-chng>> and the `replication.status.activity` property -- see; {url-api-enum-replicator-activity}.
This enables you to know, for example, when the replication is actively transferring data and when it has stopped.

ifndef::is-p2p[You can also choose to monitor document changes -- see: <<lbl-repl-evnts>>.]

[#lbl-repl-chng]
== Change Listeners
Use this to monitor changes and to inform on sync progress; this is an optional step.
You can add and a replicator change listener at any point; it will report changes from the point it is registered.

.Best Practice
TIP: Don't forget to save the token so you can remove the listener later

Use the {url-api-class-replicator} class to add a change listener as a callback to the Replicator ({url-api-method-replicator-add-change-listener}) -- see: <<ex-repl-mon>>.
You will then be asynchronously notified of state changes.

You can remove a change listener with {url-api-method-replicator-rmv-change-listener}.

=== Using Kotlin Flows and LiveData
Android Kotlin developers can take advantage of Flows and LiveData to monitor replicators.

[#lbl-repl-status]
== Replicator Status

You can use the
ifdef::is-android,is-java,is-objc[]
{url-api-class-replicator-status} class
endif::[]
ifdef::is-c,is-csharp[]
{url-api-class-replicator-status} struct
endif::[]
ifdef::is-swift[]
{url-api-class-replicator} class's {url-api-properties-replicator-status} property
endif::[]
to check the replicator status.
That is, whether it is actively transferring data or if it has stopped -- see: <<ex-repl-mon>>.

// // ifeval::["{source-language"=="objc"]
// Alternatively, use the {url-api-class-replicator-status} class to get status information.
The returned _ReplicationStatus_ structure comprises:

* {url-api-enum-replicator-activity} -- stopped, offline, connecting, idle or busy -- see states described in: <<tbl-states>>
* {url-api-enum-replicator-progress}
** completed -- the total number of changes completed
** total -- the total number of changes to be processed
* {url-api-enum-replicator-error} -- the current error, if any

[#lbl-repl-states]
=== Replication States
<<tbl-states>> shows the different states, or activity levels, reported in the API; and the meaning of each.

.Replicator activity levels
[#tbl-states,cols="^1,4"]
|===
h|State
h|Meaning

|`STOPPED`
|The replication is finished or hit a fatal error.

|`OFFLINE`
|The replicator is offline as the remote host is unreachable.

|`CONNECTING`
|The replicator is connecting to the remote host.

|`IDLE`
|The replication caught up with all the changes available from the server.
The `IDLE` state is only used in continuous replications.

|`BUSY`
|The replication is actively transferring data.
|===

NOTE: The replication change object also has properties to track the progress (`change.status.completed` and `change.status.total`).
Since the replication occurs in batches the total count can vary through the course of a replication.

== Monitor Document Changes

You can choose to register for document updates during a replication.

For example, the code snippet in <<ex-reg-doc-listener>> registers a listener to monitor document replication performed by the replicator referenced by the variable `replicator`.
It prints the document ID of each document received and sent.
Stop the listener as shown in <<ex-stop-doc-listener>>.

.Register a document listener

:param-leader: This code snippet shows how to stop the document listener using the token from the previous example.

=== Document Access Removal Behavior

When access to a document is removed on Sync Gateway (see: Sync Gateway's xref:sync-gateway::sync-function-api.adoc[Sync Function]), the document replication listener sends a notification with the `AccessRemoved` flag set to `true` and subsequently purges the document from the database.

[#lbl-repl-pend]
== Documents Pending Push

TIP: {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} is quicker and more efficient.
Use it in preference to returning a list of pending document IDs, where possible.

You can check whether documents are waiting to be pushed in any forthcoming sync by using either of the following API methods:

* Use the {url-api-method-replicator-getPendingDocumentIds} method, which returns a list of document IDs that have local changes, but which have not yet been pushed to the server.
+
This can be very useful in tracking the progress of a push sync, enabling the app to provide a visual indicator to the end user on its status, or decide when it is safe to exit.

* Use the {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} method to quickly check whether an individual document is pending a push.

[#ex-pending]
.Use Pending Document ID API
:param-tags: replication-pendingdocuments
include::ROOT:partial$block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> {url-api-method-replicator-getPendingDocumentIds} returns a list of the document IDs for all documents waiting to be pushed.
This is a snapshot and may have changed by the time the response is received and processed.
<.> {url-api-method-replicator-isDocumentPending} returns `true` if the document is waiting to be pushed, and `false` otherwise.
