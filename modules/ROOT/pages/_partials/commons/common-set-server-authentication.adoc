Note that the client cannot authenticate the server if TLS is turned off.
When TLS is enabled (Sync Gateway's default) the client _must_ authenticate the server.
If the server cannot provide acceptable credentials then the connection will fail.

:this-prop:
Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` properties {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-setPinnedServerCertificate}, to tell the replicator how to verify server-supplied TLS server certificates.

* If there is a pinned certificate, nothing else matters, the server cert must *exactly* match the pinned certificate.
* If there are no pinned certs and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} is `true` then any self-signed certificate is accepted.  Certificates that are not self signed are rejected, no matter who signed them.
* If there are no pinned certificates and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} is `false` (default), the client validates the serverâ€™s certificates against the system CA certificates.  The server must supply a chain of certificates whose root is signed by one of the certificates in the system CA bundle.
