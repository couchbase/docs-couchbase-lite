== Overview


=== Document Structure

In {cbl-te} the term 'document' refers to an entry in the database; a record, or row in a table if you like.

Each document has an ID (primary key in other databases) by which it can be located.
This ID can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.
The document also has a value which contains the actual application data.
This value is stored as a dictionary collection of key-value (k-v) pairs where the values themselves may comprise different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects -- see: <<Data Types>>

=== Data Encoding

The document body is stored in an internal, efficient, binary form (
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/fleece#readme[Fleece]
). +
This internal form is easily converted into a manageable native dictionary format for manipulation in applications.

Fleece data is stored in the smallest format that will hold the value, whilst maintaining the integrity of the value.


ifdef::is-android[]
[discrete]
=== Fleece data encoding

When working with Android-Java, the Fleece encoding cycle can result in the Java type information being lost.
So, care should be taken when storing and recovering data in a document - or converting that document to JSON and back - using non-explicit functions such as `toArray()` or `toMap()`.

Always use explicit creation of the expected type, whenever the type of result is not itself explicit. For example:

[source, Java]
----
Map<String, Object> doc = db.getDocument(someDoc.getId()).toMap();
Long testVal = Long.valueOf(doc.get(“test”))
----

Similarly, interpreting data not stored as `boolean` as a boolean value can give inconsistent results.


endif::is-android[]

=== Data Types

The `Document` class offers a set of property accessors for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point and strings.
These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

So your document content may well comprise one or more supporting data types such as:

[,cols="1,1,1,1", grid=none ]
|===

a|* Boolean
a|* Date
a|* Double
a|* Float
a|* Int
a|* Long
a|* String

|===

In addition to these basic data types Couchbase Lite provides for the following:

[,cols="1,1", grid=none ]
|===

a|*  Dictionary -- represents a read-only key-value pair collection
*  MutableDictionary -- represents a writeable key-value pair collection

a|*  Array -- represents a readonly ordered collection of objects
*  MutableArray -- represents a writeable collection of objects

a|*  Blob -- represents an arbitrary piece of binary data |

|===

=== JSON

Couchbase Lite also provides for the direct handling of JSON data implemented in most cases by the provision of a {to-json} method on appropriate API classes (for example, on MutableDocument, Dictionary, Blob and Array) -- see <<lbl-json-data>>.


== Constructing a Document


An individual document often represents a single instance of an object in application code.
A document might be considered equivalent to a row in a relational table; with each of the document’s attributes being equivalent to a column.

Documents can contain nested structures.
This allows developers to express many-to-many relationships without requiring a reference or junction table; and is naturally expressive of hierarchical data.

Most apps will work with one or more documents, persisting them to a local database and optionally syncing them, either centrally or to the cloud.

In this section we provide an example of how you might create a `hotel` document, which provides basic contact details and price data.

.Data Model
[source]
----

hotel: {
  type: string (value = `hotel`)
  name: string
  address: dictionary {
    street: string
    city: string
    state: string
    country: string
    code: string
  }
  phones: array
  rate: float
}

----

[#ex-usage]
=== Open a Database

First we open your database.
If the database does not already exist, Couchbase Lite will create it for us.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_createdb
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

See: {database--xref} for more information

=== Create a Document

Now we create a new document to hold our application's data.

Because we will be adding data to the document we must use its mutable form.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_createdoc
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

For more on using *Documents*, see: <<Document Initializers>> and <<Mutability>>.

=== Create a Dictionary

Here we create a dictionary (`address`).
Because we want to add values into the dictionary, we must create it in _mutable_ form.

When the dictionary is retrieved, each element's value is directly accessible via its own key.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_mutdict
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

For more on using *Dictionaries*, see: <<Using Dictionaries>>

=== Create an Array

Since our hotel may have multiple lines we provide an array (`phones`) to hold contact numbers.
Again, because we want to add values into the array, we create it in _mutable_ form.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_mutarray
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

For more on using *Arrays*, see: <<Using Arrays>>

=== Populate a Document

Here we add our data to the mutable document we created earlier. Each data item is stored as a key-value pair.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_populate
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

<.> Add hotel name (string)

<.> Add average room rate (float)

<.> Add document type (string) +
Couchbase recommend using a `type` attribute to define each logical document type.

<.> Add address (dictionary)
The `address` dictionary is added to the document and stored with the key `address`. We will use this to retrieve it when needed.

<.> Add phone numbers (array)
The `phones` arrary is added to the document and stored with the key `phones`. We will use this to retrieve it when needed.

=== Save a Document

With the document now populated, we can persist to our Couchbase Lite database, auto-generating the document id.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_persist
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

=== Close the Database

With our document saved, we can now close our Couchbase Lite database.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_closedb
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

ifdef::is-c[]
=== Release resources

Now we have finished and can release the resources.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_release
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
endif::is-c[]


== Working with Data


ifndef::is-c,is-objc[]
=== Checking a Document's Properties

To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use the {url-api-method-document-contains} method.

If the property doesn't exist, the call will return the default value for that getter method (0 for {url-api-method-document-getint} 0.0 for {url-api-method-document-getfloat} etc.).
endif::[]

ifdef::is-android[]
.Fleece data encoding
[NOTE]
--
Care should be taken when storing and recovering data in a document or converting that document to JSON and back. +
Data encoding (Fleece) can result in `Long` values being converted to `Float` instead of `Double`. +
Interpreting data as boolean can also give inconsistent results.
--

endif::is-android[]

ifndef::is-c[]
=== Date accessors

As a convenience Couchbase Lite offers _Date_ accessors.
Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.

.Date Getter
[#ex-date-getter]
:param-tags: date-getter
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the {url-api-method-document-getdate} accessor method.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
endif::[]


=== Using Dictionaries

.API References

* {url-api-class-dictionary}

ifndef::is-c[* {url-api-class-mutabledictionary}]


.Read Only
[#ex-dict]
:param-tags: datatype_dictionary
// :param-leader: pass:q,a[Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.]

:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


=== Using Blobs

For more on working with blobs -- see {blob--xref}


== Document Initializers


The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The {url-api-method-mutabledocument-init} initializer can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.

* The {url-api-method-mutabledocument-initid} initializer can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.

* The {url-api-method-database-getdocument} method can be used to get a document.
If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.


.Persist a document
[#ex-persists-doc]
:param-tags: initializer
:param-leader: pass:q,a[The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


== Mutability


ifdef::is-c[]
Couchbase Lite for C's document objects `CBLDocument*` can be either mutable or immutable.
Reference an immutable document using a `const` pointer and a mutable document using a non-const pointer to prevent developers from accidentally calling a mutable-document function on an immutable document.

To make an immutable document mutable, you need to use {url-api-method-mutabledocument-copy}

[source,{source-language}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
CBLDocument* CBLDocument_MutableCopy(const CBLDocument* doc _cbl_nonnull)
_cbl_warn_unused _cbl_returns_nonnull;
----

endif::is-c[]
ifndef::is-c[]
By default, when a document is read from the database it is immutable.
The {url-api-method-document-tomutable} method should be used to create an instance of the document which can be updated.

endif::is-c[]

.Make a mutable document
[#ex-update-doc]
:param-tags: update-document
:param-leader: pass:q,a[Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

NOTE: Any user change to the value of reserved keys (`_id`, `_rev` or `_deleted`) will be detected when a document is saved and will result in an exception (Error Code 5 -- `CorruptRevisionData`) -- see also <<lbl-doc-constraints>>.


ifeval::["{param-module}"=="swift"]
== Document Conversion


A `Document` can be converted to a plain dictionary type and-or to a JSON string.
This can often be useful to pass the document contents as a plain object to another method.

.Convert document
[#ex-conv-doc]
:param-tags: to-dictionary;to-json
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
<.> Returns a Dictionary<String, Any>
<.> Returns a JSON string
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

endif::[]


== Batch operations


If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

.Batch operations
[#ex-batch-ops]
:param-tags: batch
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.


== Document change events


It is possible to register for document changes.
The following example registers for changes to the document with ID `user.john` and prints the `verified_account` property when a change is detected.


.Document change events
[#ex-doc-events]
:param-tags: document-listener
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

ifdef::is-android[]

=== Using Kotlin Flows and LiveData

Kotlin users can also take advantage of Flows and LiveData to monitor for changes.

The following methods show how to watch for document changes in a given database or for changes to a specific document.

[{tabs}]
=====
Database Changes::

=====

endif::is-android[]


== Document Expiration


Document expiration allows users to set the expiration date for a document.
When the document expires, it is purged from the database.
The purge is not replicated to Sync Gateway.

.Set document expiration
[#ex-set-doc-exp]
:param-tags: document-expiration
:param-leader: This example sets the TTL for a document to 5 minutes from the current time.
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


[#lbl-doc-constraints]
== Document Constraints


Couchbase Lite APIs do not explicitly disallow the use of attributes with the underscore prefix at the top level of document.
This is to facilitate the creation of documents for use either in _local only_ mode where documents are not synced, or when used exclusively in peer-to-peer sync.

NOTE: "_id", :"_rev" and "_sequence" are reserved keywords and must not be used as top-level attributes -- see <<res-keys>>.

Users are cautioned that any attempt to sync such documents to Sync Gateway will result in an error.
To be future proof, you are advised to avoid creating such documents.
Use of these attributes for user-level data may result in undefined system behavior.

For more guidance -- see: xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:data-modeling.adoc[Sync Gateway - data modeling guidelines]

[#res-keys]
.Reserved Keys List
====

* _attachments

* _deleted {fn-rsvd-wds}

[#lbl-json-data]
== Working with JSON Data


In this section::
<<lbl-array>>
ifndef::is-c[| <<lbl-blob>>]
| <<lbl-dictionary>>
| <<lbl-document>>
| <<lbl-result>>


The {to-json} typed-accessor means you can easily work with JSON data, native and Couchbase Lite objects.

[#lbl-array]
=== Arrays

Convert an `ArrayObject` to and from JSON using the {to-json} and `toArray` methods -- see: <<ex-array>>.

Additionally you can:

* Initialize a 'MutableArrayObject' using data supplied as a JSON string.
This is done using the `init(json)` constructor-- see: <<ex-array>>

* Convert an `ArrayFragment` object to a JSON String

* Set data with a JSON string using `setJSON()`

.Arrays as JSON strings

ifndef::is-c[]
[#lbl-blob]
=== Blobs
Convert a `Blob` to JSON using the `toJSON` method -- see <<ex-blob>>.

You can also check whether a given dictionary object is a blob, or not, using `isBlob()` -- again, see <<ex-blob>>.

Note that the blob object must first be saved to the database (generating required metadata) before you can use the `toJSON` method.

=== Dictionaries

Convert a `DictionaryObject` to and from JSON using the `toJSON` and `toDictionary` methods -- see <<ex-dictionary>>.

Additionally you can:

* Initialize a 'MutableDictionaryObject' using data supplied as a JSON string.
This is done using the `init(json)` constructor-- see: <<ex-dictionary>>

* Set data with a JSON string using `setJSON()`
