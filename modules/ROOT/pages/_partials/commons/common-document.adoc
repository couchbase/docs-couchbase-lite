== Overview

In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object -- a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects.
Every document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.

== Initializers

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The {url-api-method-mutabledocument-init} initializer can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The {url-api-method-mutabledocument-initid} initializer can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.
* The {url-api-method-database-getdocument} method can be used to get a document.
If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.

.Persist a document
====

[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet}[tag=initializer,indent=0]

== Mutability

By default, when a document is read from the database it is immutable.
The {url-api-method-document-tomutable} method should be used to create an instance of the document which can be updated.

.Make a mutable document
====
Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.

NOTE: Any user change to the value of reserved keys (`_id`, `_rev` or `_deleted`) will be detected when a document is saved and will result in an exception (Error Code 5 -- `CorruptRevisionData`) -- see also <<document-constraints>>.


== Typed Accessors

=== Scalar type
The `Document` class now offers a set of {url-api-class-dictionary} for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point and strings.
These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

=== Date accessors
// DateTimeOffset c#
In addition, as a convenience we offer `Date` accessors.
Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.
The following example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the {url-api-method-document-getdate} accessor method.

include::{snippet}[tag=date-getter,indent=0]

=== Checking for properties
To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use the {url-api-method-document-contains} method.

If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default value for that getter method (0 for {url-api-method-document-getint} 0.0 for {url-api-method-document-getfloat} etc.).

=== Document to dictionary
A `Document` can be converted to a plain dictionary type.
That's often useful to pass the document contents as a plain object to another method.

== Batch operations

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

----
include::{snippet}[tag=batch,indent=0]
----

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

== Document change events

It's also possible to register for document changes.
The following example registers for changes to the document with ID `user.john` and prints the `verified_account` property.

== Document Expiration

[#lbl-doc-constraints]
== Document Constraints

Couchbase Lite APIs do not explicitly disallow the use of attributes with the underscore prefix at the top level of document.
This is to facilitate the creation of documents for use either in _local only_ mode where documents are not synced, or when used exclusively in peer-to-peer sync.

NOTE: "_id", :"_rev" and "_sequence" are reserved keywords and must not be used as top-level attributes -- see <<res-keys>>.

Users are cautioned that any attempt to sync such documents to Sync Gateway will result in an error.
To be future proof, you are advised to avoid creating such documents.
Use of these attributes for user-level data may result in undefined system behavior.

For more guidance -- see: xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:data-modeling.adoc[Sync Gateway - data modeling guidelines]
