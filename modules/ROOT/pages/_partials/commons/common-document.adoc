== Overview


=== Document Structure

In {cbl-te} the term 'document' refers to an entry in the database.
You can compare it to a record, or a row in a table.

Each document has an ID or unique identifier.
This ID is similar to a primary key in other databases.

You can specify the ID programmatically.
If you omit it, it will be automatically generated as a UUID.

NOTE: Couchbase documents are assigned to a xref:database.adoc#database-concepts[Collection].
The ID of a document must be unique within the Collection it is written to.
You cannot change it after you have written the document.

The document also has a value which contains the actual application data.
This value is stored as a dictionary of key-value (k-v) pairs.
The values can be made of up several different <<Data Types>> such as numbers, strings, arrays, and nested objects.


=== Data Encoding

The document body is stored in an internal, efficient, binary form called
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/fleece#readme[Fleece].
This internal form can be easily converted into a manageable native dictionary format for manipulation in applications.

Fleece data is stored in the smallest format that will hold the value whilst maintaining the integrity of the value.



ifdef::is-android[]
[discrete]
=== Fleece data encoding

When working with Android-Java, the Fleece encoding cycle can result in the Java type information being lost.
Therefore care should be taken with non-explicit functions such as `toArray()` or `toMap()`,
when storing and recovering data in a document,
or converting that document to JSON and back.

Always use explicit creation of the expected type, whenever the type of result is not itself explicit. For example:

[source, Java]
----
Map<String, Object> doc = collection.getDocument(someDoc.getId()).toMap();
Long testVal = Long.valueOf(doc.get(“test”))
----

Similarly, interpreting data not stored as `boolean` as a boolean value can give inconsistent results.

endif::is-android[]



=== Data Types

The `Document` class offers a set of property accessors for various scalar types, such as:

* Boolean
* Date
* Double
* Float
* Int
* Long
* String

These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you expect.

In addition to these basic data types Couchbase Lite provides for the following:

Dictionary:: represents a read-only key-value pair collection
MutableDictionary:: represents a writeable key-value pair collection
Array:: represents a readonly ordered collection of objects
MutableArray:: represents a writeable collection of objects
Blob:: represents an arbitrary piece of binary data



=== JSON

Couchbase Lite also provides for the direct handling of JSON data implemented in most cases by the provision of a {to-json} method on appropriate API classes (for example, on MutableDocument, Dictionary, Blob and Array) -- see <<lbl-json-data>>.


== Constructing a Document


An individual document often represents a single instance of an object in application code.

You can consider a document as the equivalent of a 'row' in a relational table,
with each of the document's attributes being equivalent to a 'column'.

Documents can contain nested structures.
This allows developers to express many-to-many relationships without requiring a reference or join table,
and is naturally expressive of hierarchical data.

Most apps will work with one or more documents, persisting them to a local database and optionally syncing them, either centrally or to the cloud.

In this section we provide an example of how you might create a `hotel` document, which provides basic contact details and price data.

.Data Model
[source]
----

hotel: {
  type: string (value = `hotel`)
  name: string
  address: dictionary {
    street: string
    city: string
    state: string
    country: string
    code: string
  }
  phones: array
  rate: float
}

[#ex-usage]
=== Open a Database

First open your database.
If the database does not already exist, Couchbase Lite will create it for you.

Couchbase documents are assigned to a xref:database.adoc#database-concepts[Collection].
All the CRUD examples in this document operate on a `collection` object (here, the Default Collection).

:param-tags: datatype_usage_createdb
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

See {database--xref} for more information

=== Create a Document

Now create a new document to hold your application's data.

Use the mutable form, so that you can add data to the document.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_createdoc
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

For more on using *Documents*, see <<Document Initializers>> and <<Mutability>>.

=== Create a Dictionary

Now create a mutable dictionary (`address`).

Each element of the dictionary value will be directly accessible via its own key.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_mutdict
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

Learn more about <<Using Dictionaries>>.

=== Create an Array

Since the hotel may have multiple contact numbers, provide a field (`phones`) as a mutable array.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_mutarray
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

Learn more about <<Using Arrays>>

=== Populate a Document

Now add your data to the mutable document created earlier.
Each data item is stored as a key-value pair.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_populate
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:


NOTE: Couchbase recommend using a `type` attribute to define each logical document type.


=== Save a Document

Now persist the populated document to your Couchbase Lite database.
This will auto-generate the document id.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_persist
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

=== Close the Database

With your document saved, you can now close our Couchbase Lite database.

:param-tags: datatype_usage_closedb
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

ifdef::is-c[]
=== Release resources

Finally, release the resources.

== Working with Data


ifndef::is-c,is-objc[]
=== Checking a Document's Properties

To check whether a given property exists in the document, use the {url-api-method-document-contains} method.

If you try to access a property which doesn't exist in the document, the call will return the default value for that getter method (0 for {url-api-method-document-getint} 0.0 for {url-api-method-document-getfloat} etc.).
endif::[]

ifdef::is-android[]
.Fleece data encoding
[NOTE]
--
Care should be taken when storing and recovering data in a document or converting that document to JSON and back. +
Data encoding (Fleece) can result in `Long` values being converted to `Float` instead of `Double`. +
Interpreting data as boolean can also give inconsistent results.
--

endif::is-android[]

ifndef::is-c[]
=== Date accessors

Couchbase Lite offers _Date_ accessors as a convenience.
Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.

.Date Getter
[#ex-date-getter]
:param-tags: date-getter
:param-leader: pass:q,a[This example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the {url-api-method-document-getdate} accessor method.]

:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:
endif::[]


=== Using Dictionaries

:param-leader!:


=== Using Blobs

For more on working with blobs, see {blob--xref}


== Document Initializers


You can use the following methods/initializers:

* Use the {url-api-method-mutabledocument-init} initializer to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.

* Use the {url-api-method-mutabledocument-initid} initializer to create a new document with a specific ID.

* Use the {url-api-method-collection-getdocument} method to get a document.
If the document doesn't exist in the collection, the method will return `null`.
You can use this behavior to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the collection.


.Persist a document
[#ex-persists-doc]
:param-tags: initializer
:param-leader: pass:q,a[The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


== Mutability


ifdef::is-c[]
Couchbase Lite for C's `CBLDocument*` objects can be either mutable or immutable.
Reference an immutable document using a `const` pointer and a mutable document using a non-const pointer to prevent developers from accidentally calling a mutable-document function on an immutable document.

To make an immutable document mutable, use {url-api-method-mutabledocument-copy}.

[source,{source-language}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
CBLDocument* CBLDocument_MutableCopy(const CBLDocument* doc _cbl_nonnull)
_cbl_warn_unused _cbl_returns_nonnull;
----

endif::is-c[]
ifndef::is-c[]
By default, a document is immutable when it is read from the database.
Use the {url-api-method-document-tomutable} to create an updatable instance of the document.

endif::is-c[]

.Make a mutable document
[#ex-update-doc]
:param-tags: update-document
:param-leader: pass:q,a[Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.]
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

NOTE: Any user change to the value of reserved keys (`_id`, `_rev` or `_deleted`) will be detected when a document is saved and will result in an exception (Error Code 5 -- `CorruptRevisionData`) -- see also <<lbl-doc-constraints>>.


ifeval::["{param-module}"=="swift"]
== Document Conversion


You can convert a `Document` to a plain dictionary type and/or to a JSON string.
This can often be useful to pass the document contents as a plain object to another method.

.Convert document
[#ex-conv-doc]
:param-tags: to-dictionary;to-json
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

endif::[]


== Batch operations

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

.Batch operations
[#ex-batch-ops]
:param-tags: batch
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.


== Document change events

You can register for document changes.
The following example registers for changes to the document with ID `user.john` and prints the `verified_account` property when a change is detected.


.Document change events
[#ex-doc-events]
:param-tags: document-listener

=== Using Kotlin Flows and LiveData

Kotlin users can also take advantage of Flows and LiveData to monitor for changes.

The following methods show how to watch for document changes in a given database or for changes to a specific document.

[{tabs}]
=====
Database Changes::
+
--
[source, Kotlin, subs="attributes+"]
----
fun watchQuery(query: Query): LiveData<List<Result>> {
        return query.queryChangeFlow()
            .mapNotNull { change ->
                val err = change.error
                if (err != null) {
                    throw err
                }
                change.results?.allResults()
            }
            .asLiveData()
        // end::flow-as-query-change-listener[]
    }
}

        // end::flow-as-database-change-listener[]
        // tag::flow-as-document-change-listener[]
        return collection.documentChangeFlow("1001")
            .mapNotNull { change ->
                change.takeUnless {
                    collection.getDocument(it.documentID)?.getString("owner").equals(owner)
                }
            }
            .asLiveData()
    }
----

endif::is-android[]


== Document Expiration

Document expiration allows users to set the expiration date for a document.
When the document expires, it is purged from the database.
The purge is not replicated to Sync Gateway.

.Set document expiration
[#ex-set-doc-exp]
:param-tags: document-expiration
:param-leader: This example sets the TTL for a document to 1 day from the current time.
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:

You can set expiration for a whole Collection 

[#lbl-doc-constraints]
== Document Constraints

Couchbase Lite APIs do not explicitly disallow the use of attributes with the underscore prefix at the top level of document.
This is to facilitate the creation of documents for use either in _local only_ mode where documents are not synced, or when used exclusively in peer-to-peer sync.

NOTE: "_id", :"_rev" and "_sequence" are reserved keywords and must not be used as top-level attributes -- see <<res-keys>>.

Users are cautioned that any attempt to sync such documents to Sync Gateway will result in an error.
To be future proof, you are advised to avoid creating such documents.
Use of these attributes for user-level data may result in undefined system behavior.

For more guidance -- see: xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:data-modeling.adoc[Sync Gateway - data modeling guidelines]

[#res-keys]
.Reserved Keys List
====

* _attachments

* _deleted {fn-rsvd-wds}

== Working with JSON Data

In this section::
<<lbl-array>>
ifndef::is-c[| <<lbl-blob>>]
| <<lbl-dictionary>>
| <<lbl-document>>
| <<lbl-result>>


The {to-json} typed-accessor means you can easily work with JSON data, native and Couchbase Lite objects.

[#lbl-array]
=== Arrays

Convert an `ArrayObject` to and from JSON using the {to-json} and `toArray` methods -- see <<ex-array>>.

Additionally you can:

* Initialize a 'MutableArrayObject' using data supplied as a JSON string.
This is done using the `init(json)` constructor -- see: <<ex-array>>

* Convert an `ArrayFragment` object to a JSON String

* Set data with a JSON string using `setJSON()`

ifndef::is-c[]
[#lbl-blob]
=== Blobs
Convert a `Blob` to JSON using the `toJSON` method -- see <<ex-blob>>.

You can use `isBlob()` to check whether a given dictionary object is a blob or not -- see <<ex-blob>>.

Note that the blob object must first be saved to the database (generating the required metadata) before you can use the `toJSON` method.
