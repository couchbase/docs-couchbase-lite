Couchbase{nbsp}Lite's Peer-to-Peer Synchronization solution offers secure storage and bidirectional synchronization of data between edge devices without the need for a centralized cloud-based control point.

Two Couchbase{nbsp}Lite instances can directly synchronize with each other, rather than with a Sync{nbsp}Gateway instance, by using a listener to interact with a Couchbase{nbsp}Lite replicator.

Couchbase{nbsp}Lite provides two options for implementing the required listener in IP-based networks; an out-of-the-box listener implementation or a framework to custom build your own listener.
