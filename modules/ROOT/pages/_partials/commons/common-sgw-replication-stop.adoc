Stopping a replication is straightforward.
It is done using {url-api-method-replicator-stop}.
This initiates an asynchronous operation and so is not necessarily immediate.
Your app should account for this potential delay before attempting any subsequent operations.

You can find further information on database operations in {database--xref}.

<.> Here we initiate the stopping of the replication using the {url-api-method-replicator-stop} method.
It will stop any active <<lbl-repl-chng, change listener>> once the replication is stopped.
