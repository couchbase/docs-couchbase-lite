DOC-6340-H2-P2P: New topic - Implementing P2P Sync
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-6340

This is the how-to for P2P snc using websockets

[#introduction]
== Introduction
This content provides sample code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over websockets.
Specifically it covers the implementation of an {glos-term-active-peer}.

This _active peer_ (also referred to as a client and-or a replicator) will initiate connection with a {glos-term-passive-peer} (also referred to as a server and-or listener) and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both databases into sync.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tags=securestorage]

== Configuration Summary
You should configure and initialize a replicator for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to sync.
<<simple-replication-to-listener>> shows the initialization and configuration process.

*Notes on Example*

<.> Use the {url-api-class-replicator-config} class's constructor -- {url-api-constructor-replicator-config-db-tgt} -- to initialize the replicator configuration with the local database -- see also: <<configure-target>>

<.> Configure how the client will authenticate the server.
Here we say connect only to servers presenting a self-signed certificate.
By default, clients accept only servers presenting certificates that can be verified using the OS bundled Root CA Certificates -- see: <<authenticating-the-listener>>.

<.> Configure the credentials the client will present to the server.
Here we say to provide _Basic Authentication_ credentials. Other options are available -- see: <<client-authentication>>.

<.> Configure how the replication should perform <<conflict-resolution>>.

<.> Initialize the replicator using your configuration object.

<.> Register an observer, which will notify you of changes to the replication status.

<.> Start the replicator.

== API References

You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure active peers to connect to those.

Prior to connecting with a listener you may execute a peer discovery phase to dynamically discover peers.

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-ios}"]
For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Bonjour_-- see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Network Service Discovery_ -- see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd.
endif::[]

// image::ROOT:replication.svg[,800]

== Configure Replicator
In this section: <<configure-target>>  |  <<sync-mode>>  |  <<authenticating-the-listener>>  | <<client-authentication>>

=== Configure Target
Use the
{url-api-class-replicator-config} class and {url-api-constructor-replicator-config-db-tgt} constructor to initialize the replication configuration with local and remote database locations.

The constructor provides

* the name of the local database to be sync'd
* the listener's URL (including its port and the name of the remote database to sync with) -- whether pre-configured or gathered during a discovery phase.
+
--
The URL scheme for web socket URLs uses `ws:` (non-TLS) or `wss:` (SSL/TLS) prefixes.
ifeval::[{param-platform}=={android-platform}]
include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tags=android-manifest-cleartext]
endif::[]

// You will also need any security credentials provided (for example, user name and password or Cert) for use in the authentication phase of configuration.

// Example 2

*Notes on Example*

<.> Note use of the `wss://` prefix to ensure TLS encryption (strongly recommended in production).
====

=== Sync Mode
Here we define the direction and type of replication we want to initiate.

We use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` class's {url-api-prop-replicator-config-rep-type} and
`{url-api-prop-replicator-config-cont}` parameters, to tell the replicator:

* The direction of the replication:
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
`*PUSH_AND_PULL*`; `PULL`; `PUSH`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"!="{platform-android}"]
`*pushAndPull*`; `pull`; `push`
endif::[]
* The type of replication, that is:
** Continuous -- remaining active indefinitely to replicate changed documents (`continuous=true`).
** Ad-hoc -- a one-shot replication of changed documents (`continuous=false`).

=== Authenticating the Listener
Define the credentials the client is expecting fom the server in order to ensure that the server (listener) is one it is prepared to interact with.

Note that the client cannot authenticate the server if TLS is turned off. When TLS is enabled (default) the client _must_ authenticate the server. If the server cannot provide acceptable credentials then the connection will fail.

:this-prop:
:this-prop:
Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` methods  {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-setPinnedServerCertificate}, to tell the replicator how to verify server-supplied TLS server certificates.

* If there are pinned certificates, nothing else matters, the server cert must *exactly* match one of the pinned certs.
* If there are no pinned certs and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} is `true` then any self-signed certificate is accepted.  Certificates that are not self signed are rejected, no matter who signed them.
* If there are no pinned certificates and {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate} is `false` (default), the client validates the serverâ€™s certificates against the system CA certificates.  The server must supply a chain of certificates whose root is signed by one of the certificates in the system CA bundle.

=== Client Authentication
Here we define the credentials that the client can present to the server if prompted to do so in order that the server can authenticate it.

We use {url-api-class-replicator-config}'s {url-api-prop-replicator-config-auth} method to define the authentication method to the replicator - see <<configuring-client-authentication>>.

==== Basic Authentication
Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-basic-auth}` to supply basic authentication credentials (username and password).

// Example 5
[[basic-authentication]]
.Basic Authentication
====

This example shows basic authentication using user name and password:

[source, {source-language}]
----
include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags="p2p-act-rep-auth", indent=0]

----
====

==== Certificate Authentication

Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth}` to configure the client TLS certificates to be presented to the server, on connection.
This applies only to the {url-api-class-urlendpointlistener}.

NOTE: The *server* (listener) must have `disableTLS` set `false` and have a {url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth} configured, or it will never ask for this client's certificate.

How you derive the certificate to be presented to the server will depend on the certificates that server is configured to accept:

* If the server will accept only self-signed certificates, you can bring your own, or create one using the convenience API method {url-api-method-tls-identity-create}
* If the server will accept only CA signed certificates, you will have to supply a TLSIdentity using {url-api-method-tls-identity-get}, which uses an identify provided in {securestorage}.

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
TLSIdentity.getIdentity uses the Android keystore.  Please see (Android developers documentation (for example https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) for more information about how to import a keychain.

// See {xref-cbl-pg-p2p-manage-tls-id} for more on how to do this.
// Example 6
[[configuring-client-authentication]]
.Client Cert Authentication
====
This example shows client certificate authentication using an identity from secure storage.

[source, {source-language}]
----

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=p2p-tlsid-tlsidentity-with-label, indent=0]

----

*Notes on Example*

<.> Import and create an identity from the given PKCS12 data containing private key, public key, and certificates
<.> Set the authenticator to {url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth} and configure it to use the retrieved identity

====


== Initialize Replicator

Use the `{url-api-class-replicator}` class's {url-api-constructor-replicator-init-config} constructor, to initialize the replicator with the configuration you have defined.
You can, optionally, add a change listener (see <<monitor-sync>>) before starting the replicator running using {url-api-method-replicator-start}.

// Example 7
.Initialize and run replicator

----

*Notes on Example*

<.> Initialize the replicator with the configuration
<.> Start the replicator

====

== Monitor Sync

=== Change Listeners
Use the {url-api-class-replicator} class to add a change listener as a callback to the Replicator ({url-api-method-replicator-add-change-listener}) -- see <<monitor-replication>>.
You will then be asynchronously notified of state changes.
Use this to monitor changes and to inform on sync progress, as shown below; this is an optional step.

=== Replicator Status
You can use the {url-api-class-replicator} class's {url-api-property-replicator-status} property to check the replicator status.
That is, whether it is actively transferring data or if it has stopped.

// // ifeval::["{source-language"=="objc"]
// Alternatively, use the {url-api-class-replicator-status} class to get status information.
The returned _ReplicationStatus_ structure comprises:

* {url-api-enum-replicator-activity} -- stopped, offline, connecting, idle or busy
* {url-api-enum-replicator-progress}
** completed -- the total number of changes completed
** total -- the total number of changes to be processed
* {url-api-enum-replicator-error} -- the current error, if any

For more on replication status, see: {xref-cbl-pg-replication--status}

== Stop Sync

TIP: If you added an optional change listener (see <<monitor-sync>> for how) you should also remove it using the {url-api-method-replicator-rmv-change-listener} method.

// Example 9
.Stop replicator
====
[source, {source-language}]

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags=p2p-act-rep-stop, indent=0]

----

*Notes on Example*

<.> Stopping the replication is straightforward using the {url-api-method-replicator-stop} method.

====

== Conflict Resolution

Unless you specify otherwise, Couchbase Lite's default conflict resolution policy is applied -- see {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-auto}.

To use a different policy, specify a _conflict resolver_ using {url-api-prop-replicator-config-conflict} as shown in <<using-conflict-resolvers>>.

For more complex solutions you can provide a custom conflict resolver - see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-custom}.

// Example 10
[#using-conflict-resolvers]
include::{root-partials}handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-conflict-resolvers]

Just as a replicator may observe a conflict -- when updating a document that has changed both in the local database and in a remote database -- any attempt to save a document may also observe a conflict, if a replication has taken place since the local app retrieved the document from the database. To address that possibility, a version of the `Database.save()` method also takes a conflict resolver as shown in <<merging-document-properties>>.

// Example 11
[#merging-document-properties]
include::{root-partials}handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-custom-merge]

For more on replicator conflict resolution see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict}.

== Delta Sync
// DONE: Add reference to listener section tht includes enableDeltaSync parameter being set to true
If delta sync is enabled on the listener, then replication will use delta sync.

// For more on how to:

// * Enable delta sync on the listener -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-dbo-p2psync-websocket-using-passive--delta-sync}
// * Replicator Delta Sync concept -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-replication--delta-sync}
