[#introduction]
== Introduction
This content provides sample code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over websockets.

Specifically it covers the implementation of an {glos-term-active-peer}.
This _replicator_ will initiate connection with a {glos-term-passive-peer} and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both databases into sync.

In this context the _active peer_ (replicator) acts as the _client_, whilst the _passive peer_ (listener) acts as the _server_.

You will need to initialize and configure a replicator for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to sync.
<<simple-replication-to-listener>> shows the initialization and configuration process.
Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

== API References

You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure active peers to connect to those.

Prior to connecting with a listener you may execute a peer discovery phase to dynamically discover peers.

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-ios}"]
For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Bonjour_-- see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
For the active peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Network Service Discovery_ -- see: https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd.
endif::[]

== Configure Replicator
In this section: <<configure-target>>  |  <<sync-mode>>  |  <<authenticating-the-listener>>  | <<client-authentication>>

=== Configure Target
Use the
{url-api-class-replicator-config} class and {url-api-constructor-replicator-config-db-tgt} constructor to initialize the replication configuration.

This constructor provides the name of the local database, and the listener's URL (this will include the name of the remote database to be sync'd) -- whether pre-configured or gathered during a discovery phase.

The required parameters are:

* The local database to be synced
* The listener URL including its port and the remote database name
+
--
The URL scheme for web socket URLs uses `ws:` (non-TLS) or `wss:` (SSL/TLS) prefixes.
ifeval::[{param-platform}=={android-platform}]
include::{root-partials}_block-caveats.adoc[tags=android-manifest-cleartext]
endif::[]
--

You will also need any security credentials provided (for example, user name and password or Cert) for use in the authentication phase of configuration.

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags="p2p-act-rep-initialize", indent=0]
----
<.> Note use of the `wss://` prefix to ensure TLS encryption (strongly recommended in production).
====

=== Sync Mode
Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` class's {url-api-prop-replicator-config-rep-type} and
`{url-api-prop-replicator-config-cont}` parameters, to tell the replicator:

* The direction of the replication:
ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
`*PUSH_AND_PULL*`; `PULL`; `PUSH`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{param-platform}"!="{platform-android}"]
`*pushAndPull*`; `pull`; `push`
endif::[]
* Whether the replicator should:
** Stay active indefinitely to replicate changed documents: `continuous=true`
** Be a one-shot replication of changed documents: `continuous=false`

=== Authenticating the Listener
Here we define how the client is to verify that the server (listener) is the one it wants to interact with.

:this-prop: {url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate}
Use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}`, with its {this-prop}
//{url-api-prop-replicator-config-AcceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate}
parameter, to tell the replicator how to verify TLS server certificates.

* If there are pinned certificates, nothing else matters, the server cert must *exactly* match one of the pinned certs.
* If there are no pinned certs and {this-prop} is `true` then any self-signed certificate is accepted.  Certificates that are not self signed are rejected, no matter who signed them.
* If there are no pinned certificates and {this-prop} is `false` (default), the client validates the serverâ€™s certificates against the system CA certificates.  The server must supply a chain of certificates (probably of length 1) whose root is signed by one of the certificates in the system CA bundle.

=== Client Authentication
Here we define the credentials that the client can present to the server if prompted to do so in order that the server can authenticate it.

We use {url-api-class-replicator-config}'s {url-api-prop-replicator-config-auth} method to define the authentication method to the replicator - see <<configuring-client-authentication>>.

==== Basic Authentication
Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-basic-auth}` to supply basic authentication credentials (username and password).

[[basic-authentication]]
.Basic Authentication
====

This example shows basic authentication using user name and password:

include::{snippet-p2psync-ws}[tags="p2p-act-rep-auth", indent=0]

----
====

==== Certificate Authentication

Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth}` to configure the client TLS certificates to be presented to the server, on connection.
This applies only to the {url-api-class-urlendpointlistener}.

NOTE: The *server* (listener) must have `disableTLS` set `false` and have a ClientCertificateAuthenticator configured, or it will never ask for this client's certificate.

How you derive the certificate to be presented to the server will depend on the certificates that server is configured to accept:

* If the server will accept only self-signed certificates, you can bring your own, or create one using the convenience API method {url-api-method-tls-identity-create}
* If the server will accept only CA signed certificates, you will have to supply a TLSIdentity using {url-api-method-tls-identity-get}, which uses an identify provided in {securestorage}.

ifeval::["{param-platform}"=="{platform-android}"]
TLSIdentity.getIdentity uses the Android keystore.  Please see (Android developers documentation (for example https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) for more information about how to import a keychain.

// See {xref-cbl-pg-p2p-manage-tls-id} for more on how to do this.

== Initialize Replicator

Use the `{url-api-class-replicator}` class's {url-api-constructor-replicator-init-config} constructor, to initialize the replicator with the configuration you have defined.
You can, optionally, add a change listener (see <<monitor-sync>>) before starting the replicator running using {url-api-method-replicator-start}.

----

== Monitor Sync

=== Change Listeners
Use the {url-api-class-replicator} class to add a change listener as a callback to the Replicator ({url-api-method-replicator-add-change-listener}) -- see <<monitor-replication>>.
You will then be asynchronously notified of state changes.
Use this to monitor changes and to inform on sync progress, as shown below; this is an optional step.

=== Replicator Status
You can use the {url-api-class-replicator} class's {url-api-property-replicator-status} property to check the replicator status.
That is, whether it is actively transferring data or if it has stopped.

// ifeval::["{source-language"=="objc"]
Alternatively, use the {url-api-class-replicator-status} class to get status information. The returned _ReplicationStatus_ structure comprises:

* {url-api-enum-replicator-activity} -- stopped, offline, connecting, idle or busy
* {url-api-enum-replicator-progress}
** completed The total number of changes completed
** total -- the total number of changes to be processed
* {url-api-enum-replicator-error} -- the current error, if any

For more on replication status, see: {xref-cbl-pg-replication--status}

TIP: If you added an optional change listener (see <<monitor-sync>> for how) you should also remove it using the {url-api-method-replicator-rmv-change-listener} method.

== Conflict Resolution

Unless you specify otherwise, Couchbase Lite's default conflict resolution policy is applied -- see {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-auto}.

To use a different policy, specify a _conflict resolver_ using {url-api-prop-replicator-config-conflict} as shown in <<using-conflict-resolvers>>.

For more complex solutions you can provide a custom conflict resolver - see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict-custom}.

//TODO: Update example to show how the confog resolver parameter is set (refer to the stanadrd replicator code)

[#using-conflict-resolvers]
include::{root-partials}handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-conflict-resolvers]

include::{root-partials}handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-custom-merge]

For more on replicator conflict resolution see: {xref-cbl-pg-conflict}.

== Delta Sync
// DONE: Add reference to listener section tht includes enableDeltaSync parameter being set to true
If delta sync is enabled on the listener, then replication will use delta sync.

// For more on how to:

// * Enable delta sync on the listener -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-dbo-p2psync-websocket-using-passive--delta-sync}
// * Replicator Delta Sync concept -- see: {xref-cbl-pg-replication--delta-sync}
