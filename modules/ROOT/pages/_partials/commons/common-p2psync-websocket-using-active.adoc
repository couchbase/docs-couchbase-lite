[#introduction]
== Introduction
This content provides sample code and configuration examples covering the implementation of {glos-term-peer-to-peer-sync} over WebSockets.
Specifically it covers the implementation of an {glos-term-active-peer}.

This _active peer_ (also referred to as a client and-or a replicator) will initiate the connection with a {glos-term-passive-peer} (also referred to as a server and-or listener) and participate in the replication of database changes to bring both databases into sync.

Subsequent sections provide additional details and examples for the main configuration options.

include::{root-partials}block-caveats.adoc[tags=securestorage]

== Configuration Summary
You should configure and initialize a replicator for each Couchbase Lite database instance you want to sync.
<<simple-replication-to-listener>> shows the initialization and configuration process.

.Replication configuration and initialization

include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
<.> Configure how the client will authenticate the server.
Here we say connect only to servers presenting a self-signed certificate.
By default, clients accept only servers presenting certificates that can be verified using the OS bundled Root CA Certificates -- see: <<authenticate-listener>>.

<.> Configure the credentials the client will present to the server.
Here we say to provide _Basic Authentication_ credentials. Other options are available -- see: <<configuring-client-authentication>>.

<.> Configure how the replication should perform <<conflict-resolution>>.

<.> Initialize the replicator using your configuration object.

<.> Register an observer, which will notify you of changes to the replication status.

<.> Start the replicator.

== API References

You can find {url-api-references}[{param-title} API References] here.

== Device Discovery
*This phase is optional:* If the listener is initialized on a well known URL endpoint (for example, a static IP Address or well known DNS address) then you can configure Active Peers to connect to those.

Prior to connecting with a listener you may execute a Peer discovery phase to dynamically discover Peers.

ifdef::is-ios[]
For the Active Peer this involves browsing-for and selecting the appropriate service using a zero-config protocol such as _Bonjour_-- see: https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/.

[#authenticate-listener]
=== Authenticating the Listener

Define the credentials the your app (the client) is expecting to receive from the server (listener) in order to ensure that the server is one it is prepared to interact with.

include::{root-commons}set-server-authentication.adoc[]


[#lbl-authclnt]
=== Client Authentication
ifdef::is-c[]
Couchbase Lite for C only supports the ability to replicate with a remote Sync Gateway *without TLS enabled* (`disableTLS=true`) at this release.


endif::is-c[]

Here we define the credentials that the client can present to the server if prompted to do so in order that the server can authenticate it.

We use {url-api-class-replicator-config}'s {url-api-prop-replicator-config-auth} method to define the authentication method to the replicator.

ifndef::is-c[]

==== Basic Authentication
Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-basic-auth}` to supply basic authentication credentials (username and word).

// Example 5
[[basic-authentication]]
.Basic Authentication
:param-tags: p2p-act-rep-auth
:param-leader: This example shows basic authentication using user name and password:
include::{root-partials}block_tabbed_code_example.adoc[]
:param-tags!:
:param-leader!:


==== Certificate Authentication
Use the `{url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth}` to configure the client TLS certificates to be presented to the server, on connection.
This applies only to the {url-api-class-urlendpointlistener}.

NOTE: The *server* (listener) must have `disableTLS` set `false` and have a {url-api-class-replicator-config-cert-auth} configured, or it will never ask for this client's certificate.

The certificate to be presented to the server will need to be signed by the root certificates or be valid based on the authentication callback set to the listener via ListenerCertificateAuthenticator.

ifdef::is-android[]
TLSIdentity.getIdentity uses the Android keystore.  Please see (Android developers documentation (for example https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) for more information about how to import a keychain.

include::{root-commons}sgw-replication-stop.adoc[]


== Conflict Resolution

Unless you specify otherwise, Couchbase Lite's default conflict resolution policy is applied -- see {conflict--xref}.

To use a different policy, specify a _conflict resolver_ using {url-api-prop-replicator-config-conflict} as shown in <<using-conflict-resolvers>>.

For more complex solutions you can provide a custom conflict resolver - see: {conflict--xref}.

// Example 10
[#using-conflict-resolvers]
include::{root-commons}conflict.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-conflict-resolvers]

Just as a replicator may observe a conflict -- when updating a document that has changed both in the local database and in a remote database -- any attempt to save a document may also observe a conflict, if a replication has taken place since the local app retrieved the document from the database.
To address that possibility, a version of the `Database.save()` method also takes a conflict resolver as shown in <<ex-merge-props>>.

include::{root-commons}conflict.adoc[tags=handling-conflicts-custom-merge]

For more on replicator conflict resolution see: {conflict--xref}.


== Delta Sync
// DONE: Add reference to listener section tht includes enableDeltaSync parameter being set to true
If delta sync is enabled on the listener, then replication will use delta sync.
