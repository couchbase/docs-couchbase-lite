Here we define the direction and type of replication we want to initiate.

We use `{url-api-class-replicator-config}` class's {url-api-prop-replicator-config-rep-type} and
`{url-api-prop-replicator-config-cont}` parameters, to tell the replicator:

* The direction of the replication:
ifdef::is-android[]
`*PUSH_AND_PULL*`; `PULL`; `PUSH`
endif::[]
ifndef::is-android[]
`*pushAndPull*`; `pull`; `push`
endif::[]
* The type of replication, that is:
** Continuous -- remaining active indefinitely to replicate changed documents (`continuous=true`).
** Ad-hoc -- a one-shot replication of changed documents (`continuous=false`).
