.Enterprise Edition ONLY
NOTE: Database replicas are available only in *CouchbaseLite Enterprise Edition* (https://www.couchbase.com/downloads).

Couchbase Lite supports replication between two local databases.
This allows a Couchbase Lite replicator to store data on secondary storage.
It is especially useful in scenarios where a user's device may be damaged and its data moved to a different device.
