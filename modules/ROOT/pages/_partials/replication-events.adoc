You can choose to register for document updates during a replication.

TIP: You should register the listener before starting your replication, to avoid having to do a restart to activate it.

For example, the code snippet in <<ex-reg-doc-listener>> registers a listener to monitor document replication performed by the replicator referenced by the variable `replicator`.
It prints the document ID of each document received and sent.
Stop the listener as shown in <<ex-stop-doc-listener>>.

.Document Access Removal Behavior
--
When xref:sync-gateway::sync-function-api.adoc[access to a document is removed] on Sync Gateway, the document replication listener sends a notification with the `AccessRemoved` flag set to `true` and subsequently purges the document from the database.
