By default, Sync Gateway does not enable user authorization.
This is to make it easier to get up and running with synchronization.
You can enable authorization with the following properties in the configuration file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "databases": {
    "mydatabase": {
      "users": {
        "GUEST": {"disabled": true}
      }
    }
  }
}
----

To authorize with Sync Gateway, an associated user must first be created.
Sync Gateway users can be created through the xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:refer/rest-api-admin.adoc#/user/post\__db___user_[`+POST /{tkn-db}/_user+`] endpoint on the Admin REST API.
