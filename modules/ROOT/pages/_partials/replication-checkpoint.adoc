Replicators use checkpoints to keep track of documents sent to the target database.
Without checkpoints, Couchbase Lite would replicate the entire database content to the target database on each connection, even though previous replications may already have replicated some or all of that content.

This functionality is generally not a concern to application developers.
However, if you do want to force the replication to start again from zero, use the checkpoint reset method `replicator.resetCheckpoint()` *before* starting the replicator.
