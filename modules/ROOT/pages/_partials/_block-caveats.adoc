Allow Unencrypted Network Traffic::
// tag::android-manifest-cleartext[]
To use cleartext, un-encrypted, network traffic (`http://` and-or `ws://`),  include `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the `application` element of the manifest as shown on https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted[android.com^]. +
*This not recommended in production*.
// end::android-manifest-cleartext[]

Use Background Threads::
// tag::android-threads[]
As with any network or file I/O activity, CouchbaseLite activities should not be performed on the UI thread.
*Always* use a *background* thread.

.iOS Restrictions
[CAUTION]

iOS 14 Applications::
When your application attempts to access the user's local network, iOS will prompt them to allow (or deny) access.
You can customize the message presented to the user by editing the description for the `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist`.

[NOTE]
The code examples are indicative only.
They demonstrate basic concepts and approaches to using a feature.
Use them as inspiration and adapt these examples to best practice when developing applications for your platform.

IMPORTANT: This is an https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Enterprise Edition] feature.

.Secure Storage
[NOTE]
The use of TLS, its associated keys and certificates requires using secure storage to minimize the chances of a security breach.
The implementation of this storage differs from platform to platform -- see {xref-cbl-pg-p2psync-websocket-using-secure-storage}.

.Constraints
[NOTE]
Couchbase Lite for {param-platform} does not currently support partial value indexes; indexes with non-property expressions.
You should only index with properties that you plan to use in the query.

._Xcode_ 12.3 Work Around
[IMPORTANT]
--
If you have downloaded a `.framework` package to install, you may be impacted by an existing issue in _Xcode 12.3_.
The issue prevents use of certain frameworks, displaying the error: _Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked framework was built for iOS_ -- see: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/669411[Apple Developer Forum].

The recommended solution is to use an `.xcframework` package, where possible.
Alternatively, as an interim solution, you can do the following workaround in your _Xcode_ project:

. Navigate to the target's _Build Settings_
. Locate the *Validate Workspace* setting
+
image::ROOT:xcode-12x3-fix.png[]
. Set _Validate Workspace_ to *Yes*, then return it to *No*
