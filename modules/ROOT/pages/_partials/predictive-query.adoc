Predictive Query enables Couchbase Lite queries to use machine learning, by providing query functions that can process document data (properties or blobs) via trained ML models.

PredictiveModel interface allows developers to integrate ML model into CouchbaseLite query. Developers will implement PredictiveModel which has only one function called prediction() and register the model object to CouchbaseLite with a unique model name. The registered model will be later referenced by name when the query predictive() function is called.

The input and output of the predictive model are DictionaryObject, therefore, the supported data type will be constrained by the data type that the DictionaryObject supports.

The null value returned by the prediction method will be interpreted as MISSING value in queries.
