To verify that documents have been replicated, you can:

* Monitor the Sync Gateway sequence number returned by the database endpoint (xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:rest-api.adoc#/database/get\__db__[`GET /{db}/`]). The sequence number increments for every change that happens on the Sync Gateway database.
* Query a document by ID on the Sync Gateway REST API (xref:sync-gateway:ROOT:rest-api.adoc#/document/get\__db___doc_[`GET /{db}/{id}`]).
* Query a document from the Query Workbench on the Couchbase Server Console.
