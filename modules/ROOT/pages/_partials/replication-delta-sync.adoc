* Couchbase Mobile 2.5+

With Delta Sync only the changed parts of a Couchbase document are replicated.
This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements, especially when network bandwidth is typically constrained.

Replications to a <<starting-sync-gateway, URLEndpoint>> (i.e Sync Gateway) automatically use delta sync if the xref:sync-gateway::config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-delta_sync[databases.$db.delta_sync.enabled] property is set to `true` in Sync Gateway's configuration file.

Replications to a <<database-replicas, DatabaseEndpoint>> automatically *disable* delta sync and replications to a <<peer-to-peer-sync, MessageEndpoint>> automatically *enable* delta sync.
