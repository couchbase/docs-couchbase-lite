Allow Unencrypted Network Traffic::
// tag::android-manifest-cleartext[]
To use cleartext, un-encrypted, network traffic (`http://` and-or `ws://`),  include `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the `application` element of the manifest as shown on https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted[android.com^]. +
*This not recommended in production*.

Use Background Threads::
// tag::android-threads[]
As with any network or file I/O activity, CouchbaseLite activities should not be performed on the UI thread.
*Always* use a *background* thread.

.Secure Storage
[NOTE]
The use of TLS, its associated keys and certificates requires using secure storage to minimize the chances of a security breach.
The implementation of this storage differs from platform to platform -- see {p2psync-websocket--xref--using-secure-storage}.

.Constraints
[NOTE]
Couchbase Lite for {param-platform} does not currently support partial value indexes; indexes with non-property expressions.
You should only index with properties that you plan to use in the query.

._Xcode_ 12.3 Work Around
[IMPORTANT]
--
If you have downloaded a `.framework` package to install, you may be impacted by an existing issue in _Xcode 12.3_.
The issue prevents use of certain frameworks, displaying the error: _Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked framework was built for iOS_ -- see: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/669411[Apple Developer Forum].

The recommended solution is to use an `.xcframework` package, where possible.
Alternatively, as an interim solution, you can do the following workaround in your _Xcode_ project:

. Navigate to the target's _Build Settings_
. Locate the *Validate Workspace* setting
+
image::ROOT:xcode-12x3-fix.png[]
. Set _Validate Workspace_ to *Yes*, then return it to *No*

--

// end::xcode-12x3-fix[]


//
// tag::cbl-3-0-0-reindexing[]
[IMPORTANT]
--
On upgrading from a 2.x release, all Couchbase Lite databases will be automatically re-indexed on initial database open. +
This can result in a delay before the database is usable.
--
// end::cbl-3-0-0-reindexing[]


// tag::N1QL-SQL[]
[IMPORTANT]
--
N1QL is Couchbase's implementation of the developing *{sqlpp}* standard.
As such the terms _N1QL_ and _{sqlpp}_ are used interchangeably in Couchbase documentation unless explicitly stated otherwise.
