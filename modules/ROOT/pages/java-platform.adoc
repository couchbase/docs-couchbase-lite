== GET STARTED

{cblJP} enables development and deployment of {cbl} applications to a JVM environment.
You can deploy to a desktop or web server (for example, {gpWebServerEnv}), including embedded {gpWebServerEnv} deployments.

Use this page to familiarize yourself with the product, its components, deployment, and use.

You will learn:

* Where to get the necessary binaries -- <<Where to Get Binaries>>
* What the binaries contain -- <<Using Downloaded Binaries>>
* How to deploy {cblJP} -- <<Preparing Your Build Environment>>
* How to use {cblJP} to create a simple application -- <<Building a Getting Started App>>

NOTE: We use _{gpIDE}_, _{gpBuildTool}_, _Maven_ and _{gpWebServerEnv}_ as tools to build and run the examples presented in this content.
You are free to use the tools of your choice.

== Where to Get Binaries
{cblJP} binaries are available for both Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) editions from the _Maven_ repositories -- see: <<Preparing Your Build Environment>> for how.

Alternatively, you can download a version in `.zip` format -- see: <<Using Downloaded Binaries>> for how.

== Preparing Your Build Environment

=== Prerequisites

* Planning to sync with a {svr}?
+
You will need to have runnable instances of {svr} and {sg} installed.
If you have not already done so see <<Preparatory Steps>>
* Running on Microsoft Windows?
+
Windows requires {Cpp} runtime installed.
Please install the Visual {Cpp} Redistribution package from this link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685
* Running on Linux?
+
You must have loaded the shared libraries as described in <<Additional Steps for Linux>>

=== Assumptions

This section shows how to set up and use {cblJP} to build desktop and web applications using {gpBuildTool}, Maven, {gpWebServerEnv} and {gpIDE} Community Edition.

It assumes a familiarity with these products, however you are free to use your own choice of development tools.

The contents of your `build.gradle` file will depend on the type of project you are building, whether you are using Community or Enterprise edition and whether you prefer to use Maven-distributed binaries or a zip download.

TIP: If you wish to use a downloaded zip instead of Maven then see - <<Using Downloaded Binaries>>

NOTE: If you are deploying to Linux, you will need the {cbl} `support` library, which is available _only_ on the zip download distributable -- see <<Additional Steps for Linux>>

Web App Development::
+
--

This section explains how to set-up a build project to create {cblJP} web apps using {gpBuildTool} and {gpIDE}.

*The WebApp Build Environment*

In our examples here we build and deploy web apps using a {gpBuildTool} plugin based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin. It provides a simple {gpWebServerEnv} harness that can be used from within {gpIDEce} or the command-line.

Of course if you are using {gpIDEee} you can use its integrated tomcat features to achieve the same results.

For more about this plugin and its use see <<Using the Gradle WebApp Plugin>>

anchor:bmkMultCblJapps[Running multiple {cblJP} web apps]
*Running multiple {cblJP} web apps*
Each web application has its own *class loader (WebappX). This loads the classes, jars, and resources found in the application's `WEB-INF/classes` and `WEB-INF/lib` folders, together with any shared jar files from `$CATALINA_BASE/lib` -- see link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html[tomcat documentation] for more.

So, if you are running multiple {cbl} web applications, deploy your {cbljp} library `<pathToCbl>/libs` to `$CATALINA_BASE/lib`. This means you do not need to deploy it in each web app and *minimizes the size of each app*.

NOTE:  Configuring {cbl} logging functionality will affect the logging of all web applications as the _common class loader_ shares _{cbl} Console, File_ and _Custom logging functionalities_  across all  web apps.

For information about building a WAR file see <<Deploying a WAR file to tomcat>>

*Prerequisites*

* Ensure your build environment matches the runtime {gpWebServerEnv} environment. Specifically, that the Java and  {gpWebServerEnv} versions are the same.
* If your {gpWebServerEnv} server runs Linux, declare the _shared libraries_ (`<pathToCbl>/support` --  as discussed in <<bmkLinuxSharedLibs>>) in the `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh` script file.
* Ensure the {cbl} jars (`<pathToCbl>/lib`) are on the executable path within {gpWebServerEnv} -- see: <<bmkMultCblJapps>>
+

TIP: This also means you should declare the dependencies as `providedCompile` to avoid them being bundled into the `WEB-INF/libs` folder

*Steps*

. Create a project folder and initialize it for a Gradle Java application
+
[source, bashrc]
----
gradle init
----

. Create your `build.gradle` file, including the following repositories and dependencies:

* For Community edition

== API REFERENCES

This section introduces the {cblJP} API methods available to you.

With the exception of the <<Initializer>>, all other APIs are identical to the {android} version of {cbl}.

{url-api-references}[Java SDK API References]
// link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/{version}/java.html[Java API References]

== Initializer

Your first step in using the API must be to call its initializer.
An exception is raised if any other API method is invoked before the  initializer.

The `init()` API accepts no parameters.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=sdk-initializer,indent=0]
----

== New Database

As the top-level entity in the API, new databases can be created using the `Database` class by passing in a name, configuration, or both.
The following example creates a database using the `Database(String name, DatabaseConfiguration config)` method.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=new-database,indent=0]
----

Just as before, the database will be created in a default location.
Alternatively, the `Database(string name, DatabaseConfiguration config)` initializer can be used to provide specific options in the {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/DatabaseConfiguration.html[`DatabaseConfiguration`] object such as the database directory.

== Database Encryption

.Enterprise Edition only
IMPORTANT: Database encryption is an https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Enterprise Edition] feature.

The Couchbase Lite 2.1 release includes the ability to encrypt Couchbase Lite databases.
This allows mobile applications to secure the data at rest, when it is being stored on the device.
The algorithm used to encrypt the database is 256-bit AES.

include::partial$database-encryption.adoc[leveloffset=-2]

== Finding a Database File

By default a {cblJP} database is created in a directory at the current location called  `<databaseName>.cblite2`.

This location is set by the link:{url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/DatabaseConfiguration.html[DatabaseConfiguration] method. You should always use it to explicitly set the database location. See the following example  for how to do this:
[source, java]

----
DatabaseConfiguration thisConfig = new DatabaseConfiguration(); thisConfig.setDirectory("yourDBpath");
Database thisDB = new Database("db", thisConfig);
----

== CLI tool

`cblite` is a command-line tool for inspecting and querying Couchbase Lite 2.x databases.

You can download and build it from the couchbaselabs https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/blob/master/README.cblite.md[GitHub repository].

NOTE: The `cblite` tool is not supported by the https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy[Couchbase Support Policy].

=== Logging

If you are using a Couchbase Lite release prior to 2.5 see <<Logging functionality prior to Release 2.5, Deprecated functionality>>

include::partial$logging.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

==== Logging functionality prior to Release 2.5

include::partial$logging-pre2.5.adoc[]

[source, {source-language}]

----
include::{snippet}[tags=logging,indent=0]
----

== Loading a pre-built database

If your app needs to sync a lot of data initially, but that data is fairly static and won't change much, it can be a lot more efficient to bundle a database in your application and install it on the first launch.
Even if some of the content changes on the server after you create the app, the app's first pull replication will bring the database up to date.

To use a prebuilt database, you need to set up the database, build the database into your app bundle as a resource, and install the database during the initial launch.
After your app launches, it needs to check whether the database exists.
If the database does not exist, the application should copy it from the assets folder to the app's files directory.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=prebuilt-database,indent=0]
----

In the example below, the `ZipUtils.unzip` method copies the zipped pre-built database from the application's `resource` directory to the *files* directory.
This method is provided below for information as it isn't included in the Couchbase Lite library.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=ziputils-unzip,indent=0]
----

== Document

In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object -- a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects.
Every document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.

== Initializers

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The `MutableDocument()` initializer can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The `MutableDocument(String id)` initializer can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.
* The `database.getDocument(String id)` method can be used to get a document.
If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=initializer,indent=0]
----

== Mutability

When a document is read from the database it is immutable.
Use the `document.toMutable()` method to create an updateable instance of the document.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=update-document,indent=0]
----

Changes to the document are persisted to the database when the `save` method is called.

== Typed Accessors

The `Document` class now offers a set of {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Dictionary.html[`property accessors`] for various scalar types, including boolean, integers, floating-point and strings.
These accessors take care of converting to/from JSON encoding, and make sure you get the type you're expecting.

In addition, as a convenience we offer `Date` accessors.
Dates are a common data type, but JSON doesn't natively support them, so the convention is to store them as strings in ISO-8601 format.
The following example sets the date on the `createdAt` property and reads it back using the `document.getDate(String key)` accessor method.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=date-getter,indent=0]
----

If the property doesn't exist in the document it will return the default value for that getter method (0 for `getInt`, 0.0 for `getFloat` etc.).
To check whether a given property exists in the document, you should use the {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Document.html#contains-java.lang.String-[`Document.Contains(String key)`] method.

== Batch operations

If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=batch,indent=0]
----

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.

== Document change events

It's also possible to register for document changes.
The following example registers for changes to the document with ID `user.john` and prints the `verified_account` property.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=document-listener,indent=0]
----

== Document Expiration

include::partial$document-expiration.adoc[]

== Blobs

We've renamed "attachments" to "blobs".
The new behavior should be clearer too: a `Blob` is now a normal object that can appear in a document as a property value.
In other words, you just instantiate a `Blob` and set it as the value of a property, and then later you can get the property value, which will be a `Blob` object.
The following code example adds a blob to the document under the `avatar` property.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=blob,indent=0]
----

The `Blob` API lets you access the contents as an in-memory byte array (
`public byte[] getContent()`) or as an `InputStream` (`public InputStream getContentStream()`).
It also supports an optional `type` property that by convention stores the MIME type of the contents.

In the example above, "image/jpeg" is the MIME type and "avatar" is the key which references that `Blob`.
That key can be used to retrieve the `Blob` object at a later time.

When a document is synchronized, the Couchbase Lite replicator will add an `_attachments` dictionary to the document's properties if it contains a blob.
A random access name will be generated for each `Blob` which is different to the "avatar" key that was used in the example above.
On the image below, the document now contains the `_attachments` dictionary when viewed in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.

image::attach_replicated.png[]

A blob also has properties such as `"digest"` (a SHA-1 digest of the data), `"length"` (the length in bytes), and optionally `"content_type"` (the MIME type).
The data is not stored in the document, but in a separate content-addressable store, indexed by the digest.

This `Blob` can be retrieved on the Sync Gateway REST API at \http://localhost:4984/justdoit/user.david/blob_1.
Notice that the blob identifier in the URL path is "blob_1" (not "avatar").

== Query

Database queries are based on expressions, of the form "SELECT {blank-field} FROM database WHERE {blank-field}, ORDERed by {blank-field}", with semantics based on Couchbase's N1QL query language.

There are several parts to specifying a query:

SELECT:: Specifies the projection, which is the part of the document that is to be returned.
FROM:: Specifies the database to query the documents from.
JOIN:: Specifies the matching criteria in which to join multiple documents.
WHERE:: Specifies the query criteria that the result must satisfy.
GROUP BY:: Specifies the query criteria to group rows by.
ORDER BY:: Specifies the query criteria to sort the rows in the result.

=== SELECT statement

With the SELECT statement, you can query and manipulate JSON data.
With projections, you retrieve just the fields that you need and not the entire document.

A SelectResult represents a single return value of the query statement.
You can specify a comma separated list of `SelectResult` expressions in the select statement of your query.
For instance the following select statement queries for the document `_id` as well as the `type` and `name` properties of all documents in the database.
In the query result, we print the `_id` and `name` properties of each row using the property name getter method.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-select-meta,indent=0]
----

The `SelectResult.all()` method can be used to query all the properties of a document.
In this case, the document in the result is embedded in a dictionary where the key is the database name.
The following snippet shows the same query using `SelectResult.all()` and the result in JSON.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-select-all,indent=0]
----

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "Q5",
            "icao": "MLA",
            "id": 10,
            "name": "40-Mile Air",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    },
    {
        "travel-sample": {
            "callsign": "TXW",
            "country": "United States",
            "iata": "TQ",
            "icao": "TXW",
            "id": 10123,
            "name": "Texas Wings",
            "type": "airline"
        }
    }
]
----

=== WHERE statement

Similar to SQL, you can use the where clause to filter the documents to be returned as part of the query.
The select statement takes in an `Expression`.
You can chain any number of Expressions in order to implement sophisticated filtering capabilities.

==== Comparison

The {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Expression.html[comparison operators] can be used in the WHERE statement to specify on which property to match documents.
In the example below, we use the `equalTo` operator to query documents where the `type` property equals "hotel".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-where,indent=0]
----

=== Collection Operators

{url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/ArrayFunction.html[Collection operators] are useful to check if a given value is present in an array.

==== CONTAINS Operator

The following example uses the `Function.arrayContains` to find documents whose `public_likes` array property contain a value equal to "Armani Langworth".

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "name": "Apple Droid",
    "public_likes": ["Armani Langworth", "Elfrieda Gutkowski", "Maureen Ruecker"]
}
----

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-collection-operator-contains,indent=0]
----

==== IN Operator

The `IN` operator is useful when you need to select based on a specified term matching any element of a defined list of values.
The following example compiles a list of values from `first`, `last` and `username` property value. It then selects if any of those values equals "Armani".

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-collection-operator-in,indent=0]
----

==== Like Operator

The {url-api-references}/com/couchbase/lite/Expression.html#like-com.couchbase.lite.Expression-[`like`] operator can be used for string matching.

// DOC-5813 change replicated from Java-Android during cherr-pick //

The `like` operator performs **case sensitive** matches.
So, to make the string matching case-insensitive, use `Function.lower` or `Function.upper` to transform the matched strings to lowercase or uppercase equivalents.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type `landmark` where the name property exactly matches the string "Royal engineers museum".

TIP: For case-insensitive comparison, use `Function.lower` to align the cases of the strings being compared.

The following query returns "landmark" type documents regardless of the name's case (so, for example: "Royal Engineers Museum", "royal engineers museum", "ROYAL ENGINEERS MUSEUM" are all matches).

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-like-operator,indent=0]
----

==== Wildcard Match

We can use `%` sign within a `like` expression to do a wildcard match against zero or more characters.
Using wildcards allows you to have some fuzziness in your search string.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark" where the name property matches any string that begins with "eng" followed by zero or more characters, the letter "e", followed by zero or more characters.

The following query will return "landmark" `type` documents with name matching "Engineers", "engine", "english egg" , "England Eagle" and so on.

NOTE: Once again, we are using `Function.lower` to make the search act as case insensitive.

NOTE: The matches may span word boundaries.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-like-operator-wildcard-match,indent=0]
----

==== Wildcard Character Match

We can use an `_` sign within a like expression to do a wildcard match against a single character.

In the example below, we are looking for documents of type "landmark" where the `name` property matches any string that begins with "eng" followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending in the letter "r".
The following query will return "landmark" `type` documents with the `name` matching "Engineer", "engineer" and so on.

==== Regex Operator

Similar to wildcard `like` expressions, `regex` expressions based pattern matching allow you to have some fuzziness in your search string.

The `regex` operator is case sensitive.

TIP: For more on the regex spec used by {cbl} see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/[cplusplus regex reference page]

In the example below, we are looking for documents of `type` "landmark" where the name property matches any string (on word boundaries) that begins with "eng" followed by exactly 4 wildcard characters and ending in the letter "r".
The following query will return "landmark" type documents with name matching "Engine", "engine" and so on.
Note that the `\b` specifies that the match must occur on word boundaries.

=== Query Deleted Document

You can query documents that have been deleted (tombstones).
The following example shows how to query deleted documents in the database.

----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-deleted-documents,indent=0]
----

=== JOIN statement

The JOIN clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two or more source objects.

The following example uses a JOIN clause to find the airline details which have routes that start from RIX.
This example JOINS the document of type "route" with documents of type "airline" using the document ID (`_id`) on the "airline" document and `airlineid` on the "route" document.

=== GROUP BY statement

You can perform further processing on the data in your result set before the final projection is generated.
The following example looks for the number of airports at an altitude of 300 ft or higher and groups the results by country and timezone.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "airport123",
    "type": "airport",
    "country": "United States",
    "geo": { "alt": 456 },
    "tz": "America/Anchorage"
}

[source,text]
----
There are 138 airports on the Europe/Paris timezone located in France and above 300 ft
There are 29 airports on the Europe/London timezone located in United Kingdom and above 300 ft
There are 50 airports on the America/Anchorage timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 279 airports on the America/Chicago timezone located in United States and above 300 ft
There are 123 airports on the America/Denver timezone located in United States and above 300 ft

=== ORDER BY statement

It is possible to sort the results of a query based on a given expression result.
The example below returns documents of type equal to "hotel" sorted in ascending order by the value of the title property.

=== Live Query

=== Predictive Query

include::partial$predictive-query.adoc[]

=== Indexing

Creating indexes can speed up the performance of queries.
While indexes make queries faster, they also make writes slightly slower, and the Couchbase Lite database file slightly larger.
As such, it is best to only create indexes when you need to optimize a specific case for better query performance.

The following example creates a new index for the `type` and `name` properties.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel123",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Apple Droid"
}
----

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=query-index,indent=0]
----

If there are multiple expressions, the first one will be the primary key, the second the secondary key, etc.

NOTE: Every index has to be updated whenever a document is updated, so too many indexes can hurt performance.
Thus, good performance depends on designing and creating the _right_ indexes to go along with your queries.

=== Full-Text Search

To run a full-text search (FTS) query, you must have created a full-text index on the expression being matched.
Unlike regular queries, the index is not optional.
The following example creates an FTS index on the `name` property.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=fts-index,indent=0]
----

Multiple properties to index can be specified in the index creation method.

With the index created for a given property, you can now construct and run FTS queries on that property.
The full-text search criteria is defined as a `FullTextExpression`.
The left-hand side is the full-text index to use and the right-hand side is the pattern to match.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=fts-query,indent=0]
----

In the example above, the pattern to match is a word, the full-text search query matches all documents that contain the word "buy" in the value of the `doc.name` property.

Search is supported for all languages that use whitespace to separate words.

Stemming, which is the process of fuzzy matching parts of speech, like "fast" and "faster", is supported in the following languages: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, romanian, russian, spanish, swedish and turkish.

The pattern to match can also be in the following forms:

prefix queries::
The query expression used to search for a term prefix is the prefix itself with a "*" character appended to it.
For example
+
....
"'lin*'"
....
Will search for all documents containing a term with the prefix `lin`, poducing a match for all documents that contain "linux" and also those that contain terms "linear", "linker", "linguistic" and so on.


overriding the property name that is being indexed::
Normally, a token or token prefix query is matched against the document property specified as the left-hand side of the `match` operator.
This may be overridden by specifying a property name followed by a ":" character before a basic term query.
There may be space between the ":" and the term to query for, but not between the property name and the ":" character.
For example:
+
....
'title:linux problems'
-- Query the database for documents for which the term "linux" appears in
-- the document title, and the term "problems" appears in either the title
-- or body of the document.
....

phrase queries::
A phrase query is a query that retrieves all documents that contain a nominated set of terms or term prefixes in a specified order with no intervening tokens.
Phrase queries are specified by enclosing a space separated sequence of terms or term prefixes in double quotes (").
For example:
+
....
"'"linux applications"'"
-- Query for all documents that contain the phrase "linux applications".
....

NEAR queries::
A NEAR query is a query that returns documents that contain a two or more nominated terms or phrases within a specified proximity of each other (by default with 10 or less intervening terms).
A NEAR query is specified by putting the keyword "NEAR" between two phrase, token or token prefix queries.
To specify a proximity other than the default, an operator of the form "NEAR/" may be used, where is the maximum number of intervening terms allowed.
For example:
+
....
"'database NEAR/2 "replication"'"
-- Search for a document that contains the phrase "replication" and the term
-- "database" with not more than 2 terms separating the two.
....

AND, OR & NOT query operators::
The enhanced query syntax supports the AND, OR and NOT binary set operators.
Each of the two operands to an operator may be a basic FTS query, or the result of another AND, OR or NOT set operation.
Operators must be entered using capital letters.
Otherwise, they are interpreted as basic term queries instead of set operators.
For example:
+
....
'couchbase AND database'
-- Return the set of documents that contain the term "couchbase", and the
-- term "database". This query will return the document with docid 3 only.
....
+
When using the enhanced query syntax, parenthesis may be used to specify the precedence of the various operators.
For example:
+
....
'("couchbase database" OR "sqlite library") AND linux'
-- Query for the set of documents that contains the term "linux", and at least
-- one of the phrases "couchbase database" and "sqlite library".
....

=== Ordering results

It's very common to sort full-text results in descending order of relevance.
This can be a very difficult heuristic to define, but Couchbase Lite comes with a ranking function you can use.
In the `OrderBy` array, use a string of the form `Rank(X)`, where `X` is the property or expression being searched, to represent the ranking of the result.

== Replication

include::partial$replication-introduction.adoc[leveloffset=3]

== Compatibility

WARNING: The new protocol is *incompatible* with CouchDB-based databases.
And since Couchbase Lite 2 only supports the new protocol, you will need to run a version of Sync Gateway that supports it -- see:  xref:sync-gateway::compatibility-matrix.adoc[Sync Gateway Compatibility Matrix].

To use this protocol with Couchbase Lite 2.0, the replication URL should specify WebSockets as the URL scheme (see the <<Starting a Replication>> section below).
Mobile clients using Couchbase Lite 1.x can continue to use *http* as the URL scheme.
Sync Gateway 2.0 will automatically use the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects through \http://localhost:4984/db and the 2.0 replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 2.0 client connects through "ws://localhost:4984/db".

== Starting Sync Gateway

https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Download Sync Gateway] and start it from the command line with the configuration file created above.

[source,bash]
----
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway
----

For platform specific installation instructions, refer to the Sync Gateway xref:sync-gateway::getting-started.adoc#installation[installation guide].

== Starting a Replication

Replication can be bidirectional, this means you can start a `push`/`pull` replication with a single instance.
The replication's parameters can be specified through the {url-api-references}/index.html?com/couchbase/lite/ReplicatorConfiguration.html[`ReplicatorConfiguration`] object;
for example, if you wish to start a `push` only or `pull` only replication.

The following example creates a `pull` replication with Sync Gateway.

[source]
----
class MyClass {
    Database database;
    Replicator replicator; // <1>

    void startReplication() {
        URI uri = null;
        try {
            uri = new URI("wss://10.0.2.2:4984/db"); // <2>
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        Endpoint endpoint = new URLEndpoint(uri);
        ReplicatorConfiguration config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(database, endpoint);
        config.setReplicatorType(ReplicatorConfiguration.ReplicatorType.PULL);
        this.replicator = new Replicator(config);
        this.replicator.start();
    }

}
----
<1> A replication is an asynchronous operation.
To keep a reference to the `replicator` object, you can set it as an instance property.
<2> The URL scheme for remote database URLs has changed in Couchbase Lite 2.0.
You should now use `ws:`, or `wss:` for SSL/TLS connections.
In this example the hostname is `10.0.2.2`.
+

include::partial$verify-replication.adoc[]

Couchbase Lite 2.0 uses WebSockets as the communication protocol to transmit data.
Some load balancers are not configured for WebSocket connections by default (NGINX for example);
so it might be necessary to explicitly enable them in the load balancer's configuration (see xref:sync-gateway::load-balancer.adoc[Load Balancers]).

By default, the WebSocket protocol uses compression to optimize for speed and bandwidth utilization.
The level of compression is set on Sync Gateway and can be tuned in the configuration file (xref:sync-gateway::config-properties.adoc#replicator_compression[`replicator_compression`]).

=== Replication Ordering

To optimize for speed, the replication protocol doesn't guarantee that documents will be received in a particular order.
So do not rely receiving replicated data in a specific sequence when using the replication or database change listeners for example.

=== Replicator Notifications on a Custom Executor

Prior to version 2.6, Couchbase Lite spun up multiple executors.
This policy could result in too many threads being spun up.

An executor manages a pool of threads and, perhaps, a queue in front of the executor, to handle the asynchronous callbacks.
Couchbase Lite API calls which are processed by an executor are listed below.

[source]
----
Query.addChangeListener
MessageEndpointListerner.addChangeListener
LiveQuery.addChangeListener
AbstractReplicator.addDocumentReplicationListener
AbstractReplicator.addChangeListener
Database.addChangeListener
Database.addDocumentChangeListener
Database.addDatabaseChangeListener
Database.addChangeListener
----

As of version 2.6, Couchbase sometimes uses its own internal executor to run asynchronous client code.
While this is fine for small tasks, larger tasks -- those that take significant compute time, or that perform I/O -- can block Couchbase processing.
If this happens your application will fail with a `RejectedExecutionException` and it may be necessary to create a separate executor on which to run the large tasks.

The following examples show how to specify a separate executor in the client code.
The client code executor can enforce an application policy for delivery ordering and the number of threads.

*Guaranteed Order Delivery*

[source,java]
----
/**
 * This version guarantees in order delivery and is parsimonious with space
 * The listener does not need to be thread safe (at least as far as this code is concerned).
 * It will run on only thread (the Executor's thread) and must return from a given call
 * before the next call commences.  Events may be delivered arbitrarily late, though,
 * depending on how long it takes the listener to run.
 */
public class InOrderExample {
    private static final ExecutorService IN_ORDER_EXEC = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

    public Replicator runReplicator(Database db1, Database db2, ReplicatorChangeListener listener)
        throws CouchbaseLiteException {
        ReplicatorConfiguration config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(db1, new DatabaseEndpoint(db2));
        config.setReplicatorType(ReplicatorConfiguration.ReplicatorType.PUSH_AND_PULL);
        config.setContinuous(false);

        Replicator repl = new Replicator(config);
        ListenerToken token = repl.addChangeListener(IN_ORDER_EXEC, listener::changed);

        repl.start();

        return repl;
    }
}

*Maximum Throughput*

[source,]
----
/**
 * This version maximizes throughput.  It will deliver change notifications as quickly
 * as CPU availability allows. It may deliver change notifications out of order.
 * Listeners must be thread safe because they may be called from multiple threads.
 * In fact, they must be re-entrant because a given listener may be running on mutiple threads
 * simultaneously.  In addition, when notifications swamp the processors, notifications awaiting
 * a processor will be queued as Threads, (instead of as Runnables) with accompanying memory
 * and GC impact.

*Extreme Configurability*

[source, java]

----
/**
 * This version demonstrates the extreme configurability of the CouchBase Lite replicator callback system.

 * (though it does correctly synchronizes tasks passed to it using a SynchronousQueue).
 * The thread pool executor shown here is configured for the sweet spot for number of threads per CPU.
 * In a real system, this single executor might be used by the entire application and be passed to
 * this module, thus establishing a reasonable app-wide threading policy.
 * In an emergency (Rejected Execution) it lazily creates a backup executor with an unbounded queue
 * in front of it.  It, thus, may deliver notifications late, as well as out of order.

== Troubleshooting

As always, when there is a problem with replication, logging is your friend.
The following example increases the log output for activity related to replication with Sync Gateway.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=replication-logging,indent=0]
----

== Authentication

include::partial$authentication.adoc[leveloffset=-1]

== Replication Status

The `replication.Status.Activity` property can be used to check the status of a replication.
For example, when the replication is actively transferring data and when it has stopped.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=replication-status,indent=0]
----

The following table lists the different activity levels in the API and the meaning of each one.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|State |Meaning

|`STOPPED`
|The replication is finished or hit a fatal error.

|`OFFLINE`
|The replicator is offline as the remote host is unreachable.

|`CONNECTING`
|The replicator is connecting to the remote host.

|`IDLE`
|The replication caught up with all the changes available from the server.
The `IDLE` state is only used in continuous replications.

|`BUSY`
|The replication is actively transferring data.
|===

NOTE: The replication change object also has properties to track the progress (`change.status.completed` and `change.status.total`).
But since the replication occurs in batches and the total count can vary through the course of a replication, those progress indicators are not very useful from the standpoint of an app user.
Hence, these should not be used for tracking the actual progress of the replication.

== Handling Network Errors

When _replicator_ detects a network error it updates its status depending on the error type (permanent or temporary) and returns an appropriate HTTP error code.

The following code snippet adds a `Change Listener`, which monitors a replication for errors and logs the the returned error code.

.Monitoring for network errors
[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=replication-error-handling,indent=0]
----

*For permanent network errors* (for example, `404` not found, or `401` unauthorized):
_Replicator_ will stop permanently, whether `setContinuous`  is _true_ or _false_. Of course, it sets its status to `STOPPED`

*For recoverable or temporary errors:* _Replicator_ sets its status to `OFFLINE`, then:

* If `setContinuous=_true_` it retries the connection indefinitely
* If `setContinuous=_false_` (one-shot) it retries the connection a limited number of times.

The following error codes are considered temporary by the Couchbase Lite replicator and thus will trigger a connection retry.

* `408`: Request Timeout
* `429`: Too Many Requests
* `500`: Internal Server Error
* `502`: Bad Gateway
* `503`: Service Unavailable
* `504`: Gateway Timeout
* `1001`: DNS resolution error

== Peer-to-Peer Sync

.Enterprise Edition only
IMPORTANT: Peer-to-peer sync is an https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[Enterprise Edition] feature.
You must purchase the Enterprise License which includes official https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy[Couchbase Support] to use it in production (also see the https://www.couchbase.com/licensing-and-support-faq[FAQ]).

Peer-to-peer sync allows devices running Couchbase Lite to directly sync data with each other.
As part of this, Couchbase Lite is responsible for storing the data and keeping track of the data exchange, but isn't responsible for the data transfer itself.
Sending and receiving data must be handled by the platform APIs or a third party framework.
In this section, we will refer to these third party frameworks as communication frameworks.

Thus, to enable peer-to-peer sync with Couchbase Lite, the application must use the Communication Framework with Couchbase Lite.
The following sections describe a typical peer-to-peer workflow.
Where applicable, we discuss how to integrate Couchbase Lite into the workflow.

In Couchbase Lite, a peer can take on one of these two roles:

* *Active Peer:* The peer that initializes the connection and replication (i.e the "client" side).
* *Passive Peer:* The passive side reacts to things that it receives but does not initiate any communication on its own (i.e. the "server" side).

== Connection Teardown

== Thread Safety

The Couchbase Lite API is thread safe except for calls to mutable objects: `MutableDocument`, `MutableDictionary` and `MutableArray`.

== UPGRADING

== Database

Databases created using Couchbase Lite 1.2 or later can still be used with Couchbase Lite 2.x; but will be automatically updated to the  current 2.x version.
This feature is only available for the default storage type (i.e., not a ForestDB database).
Additionally, the automatic migration feature does not support encrypted databases, so if the 1.x database is encrypted you will first need to disable encryption using the Couchbase Lite 1.x API (see the xref:1.4@{source-language}.adoc#database-encryption[1.x Database Guide]).

=== Handling of Existing Conflicts

If there are existing conflicts in the 1.x database, the automatic upgrade process copies the default winning revision to the new database and does NOT copy any conflicting revisions.

=== Handling of Existing Attachments


Attachments persisted in a 1.x database are copied to the new database.
NOTE: The relevant Couchbase Lite API is now called the `Blob` API not the `Attachments` API.

The functionally is identical but the internal schema for attachments has changed.
Blobs are stored anywhere in the document, just like other value types, whereas in 1.x they were stored under the `_attachments` field.
The automatic upgrade functionality *does not* update the internal schema for attachments, so they remain accessible under the `_attachments` field.
The following example shows how to retrieve an attachment that was created in a 1.x database with a 2.x API.

[source]
----
include::{snippet}[tags=1x-attachment,indent=0]
----

== Replication Compatibility

The current replication protocol is not backwards compatible with the 1.x replication protocol.
Therefore, to use replication with Couchbase Lite 2.x, the target Sync Gateway instance must also be upgraded to 2.x.

Sync Gateway 2.x will continue to accept clients that connect through the 1.x protocol.
It will automatically use the 1.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 1.x client connects through \http://localhost:4984/db and the 2.x replication protocol when a Couchbase Lite 2.x client connects through ws://localhost:4984/db.
This allows for a smoother transition to get all your user base onto a version of your application built with Couchbase Lite 2.x.

In addition to setting-up your build environment, you also need to make the supplied native libraries (`<pathToCbl/support`) available:

NOTE: These libraries are provided only in the `.zip` distributable.

. Copy the _native libraries_ (`<pathToCbl>/support`) to a location accessible to -- and usable by -- your build and runtime environments.
. Add the following libraries to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in `$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh:
+
NOTE: If the setenv.sh file doesn’t exist, you will need to create a new file.

+
[source, bashrc]

----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<pathToCbl>/support/linux/x86_64/libicu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<pathToCbl>/support/linux/x86_64/libz:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<pathToCbl>/support/linux/x86_64/libc++:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
----
+
Please refer to the Linux Platform Support section for the minimum version requirements of those libraries.

=== Using the Gradle WebApp Plugin

The simplest way to build and deploy your {cblJP} web app is to use a {gpBuildTool} plugin that provides a simple {gpWebServerEnv} harness.

Our examples are based on the `com.bmuschko.tomcat` plugin -- see https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin[com.bmuschko.tomcat on Github].

Including the plugin in your `build.gradle` file make a number of tomcat tasks available to you. View them using:

[source, bashrc]

----
./gradlew tasks
----

This shows that the following web application tasks are now available:

** `tomcatJasper` - Runs the JSP compiler and turns JSP pages into Java source.
** `tomcatRun` - Uses your files as and where they are and deploys them to Tomcat.
** `tomcatRunWar` - Assembles the web app into a war and deploys it to Tomcat.
** `tomcatStop` - Stops Tomcat.

So, to run the app use:

----
tomcatRun
----

=== About the Getting Started App

anchor:bmkAboutGettingStarted[]
The {nmMobStarterApp} app will:

* Create a database
+
The app creates its database in the `{nmSampleAppDbPath}` directory relative to its root location when run (See: <<Finding a Database File>>).

TIP: Explicitly state your required database location when creating your database (see: <<Finding a Database File>> for how to do this)

* Add content to the DB
* Run a simple query counting the DB rows
* Start a one-shot, bi-directional replication using {sg} and {svr}
* Produce a simple report on the db Contents
+
image::cblOutput.png[,400]

NOTE: Before starting your app ensure you have started both your {svr} and {sg} instances.

=== Deploying a WAR file to tomcat

If you want to deploy your web app to a local Tomcat instance then you will need to generate a WAR file.
However, you should note that when creating a war file, if you use the `implementation` dependency type then your _Couchbase Lite_ jar files will be bundled into WEB-INF/lib of the web application.
To exclude Couchbase Lite jar files from getting bundled and to use Couchbase Lite in multiple web applications, change the dependency type from *`implementation`* to *`providedCompile`*

. You can do this using the Gradle command below from within your project folder:
[source, bashrc]
+
----
./gradlew war
----
+
NOTE:  The generated war file will be at <PROJECT ROOT>/build/libs.


. Deploy the war file to Tomcat, by copying it to $CATALINA_BASE/webapps
+
TIP: You can also use Tomcat’s Manager App to deploy the war file -- see link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html[tomcat's Manager App] documentation for more detail.

. To use common class loader approach to load Couchbase Lite libraries, copy all of the Couchbase Lite jar files in $CATALINA_BASE/lib.
