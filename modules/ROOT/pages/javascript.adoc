== Ionic



=== Enterprise Edition Deployments

Ionic's Couchbase Lite integration is tailor-made for web developers, making it easy to build secure, high-performance, offline-enabled apps.
This premier integration supports apps built for iOS, Android, and native Windows.

Using a robust JavaScript API, you can access the entirety of Couchbase Lite's functionality with no native experience required.

As a starting point, follow the hotel search tutorial.
The tutorial shows how to build an app that allows users to search and bookmark hotels using data loaded from a Couchbase Lite database -- see tutorial at
https://ionic.io/docs/couchbase-lite/tutorials/hotel-search

=== Community Edition Deployments

You can build your own native plugin on top of Couchbase Lite's native API for iOS and Android.
The plugin is independent of the application's UI layer and can be used to access native functionality from within your Ionic apps.

Ionic recommends use of
https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins[Capacitor]
, so building a capacitor plugin would be preferred option

// * Cordova: +
// Alternatively, you have the option of building a Cordova Plugin and using that within your Ionic app.

// We have some reference implementation of a Cordova plugin and a sample Ionic app that uses the Cordova plugin.
// You can use the samples in the tutorials as a starting point and expand it to suit your application requirements.

== React Native


https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios[React Native Modules] make it easy to access native platform functionality from within your JavaScript based React Native apps.
You can leverage this to https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite-react-native/[build] your own React Native plugin on top of Couchbase Lite's native API for iOS and Android.

// Hide for now 31/01/22
// We have a couple of tutorials that describe how you can build your plugin for https://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/hotel-finder/android.html[Android] and https://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/hotel-finder/ios.html[iOS] respectively.
// You can use the samples as a starting point and expand it to suit your application requirements.
// As described in the tutorials, it is recommended that your plugin implement a subset of native APIs that is relevant to your application.
// END Hide for now 31/01/22


== Cordova


You also have the option of building a Cordova Plugin that exports a subset of Couchbase Lite native APIs to Javascript.
Within your Ionic app, you can then use Couchbase Lite as an embedded datastore for offline data storage and Sync Gateway/Couchbase Server for remote data sync.

== Electron


You can develop your own https://electronjs.org[Electron.js] wrapper on top of xref:csharp:quickstart.adoc[Couchbase Lite's C#.NET] API.
