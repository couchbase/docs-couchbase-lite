Independent lifecycle management and fine-grained security control simplifies the deployment of multi-tenant and high-application density cloud-to-edge applications at scale.

xref:android:scopes-collections-manage.adoc[Scopes and Collections] are a first class concept, synced between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway, between Sync Gateways (Inter Sync Gateway Replication), between Couchbase Lite peers, as well as available offline-first on Couchbase Lite devices.
