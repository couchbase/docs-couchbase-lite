== Release 3.2.0 - Beta 1 - iOS and Android (March 2024)

=== New Features

==== Vector Search

IMPORTANT: Vector Search is only available for 64-bit architectures.

A beta version of Vector Search is now available on Couchbase Lite for iOS (Swift, Objective-C) and Android.
Vector search is a sophisticated data retrieval technique that focuses on matching the contextual meanings of search queries and data entries, rather than simple text matching.
Vectors are represented by arrays of numbers known as embeddings, which are generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to represent objects such as text, images, and audio.
You can use Vector Search to efficiently find similar items or content based on the similarity of their vector representations. 
This is useful for reducing the cost per query, performing semantic or similarity search, providing recommendations among others.
