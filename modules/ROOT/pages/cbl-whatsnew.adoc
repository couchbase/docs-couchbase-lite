=== New Features

==== Vector Search

[IMPORTANT] 
--
Vector Search is available only for 64-bit architectures and
Intel processors that support the Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) instruction set.
To verify whether your device supports the AVX2 instructions set, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090473/processors/intel-core-processors.html[follow these instructions.] 
--

Vector Search is now available on Couchbase Lite for all platforms.
Vector Search is a sophisticated data retrieval technique that focuses on matching the contextual meanings of search queries and data entries, rather than simple text matching.
Vectors are represented by arrays of numbers known as embeddings, which are generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to represent objects such as text, images, and audio.
You can use Vector Search to efficiently find similar items or content based on the similarity of their vector representations. 
This is useful for reducing the cost per query, performing semantic or similarity search, providing recommendations among others.
