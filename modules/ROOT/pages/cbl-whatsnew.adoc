=== New Features

==== Vector Search

A beta version of Vector Search is now available on Couchbase Lite for iOS (Swift, Objective-C) and Android.
Vector Search is a  method that uses Machine Learning (ML) to numerically represent of unstructured data as vectors to better capture the meaning and context. 
These vectors are represented by arrays of numbers known as embeddings, which are generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to represent objects such as text, images, and audio.
You can use Vector Search to efficiently find similar items or content based on the similarity of their vector representations. 
This is particularly useful for large datasets and real-time response applications.
