== Getting Started

This Xcode project is used to write code examples for the documentation.
Code snippets are wrapped in AsciiDoc include tags and automatically imported in link:../../pages/objc.adoc[objc.adoc] as part of the documentation build process (saving us some copy-pasting).

To start using the project to write code examples, run the following.

. Open *code_snippets.xcodeproj* in Xcode.
. Download https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/[Couchbase Lite Enterprise Edition] and drag the *.framework* file to the *Frameworks* folder to have auto-completion and verify the code compiles.
. Code snippets are located in *SampleCodeTest.m*.
