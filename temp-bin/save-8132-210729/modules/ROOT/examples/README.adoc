== Getting Started

This folder contains IDE projects (Xcode, Android Studio and Visual Studio) to maintain the code examples that are used in the documentation.

Changes can either be submitted through the GitHub online editor or by cloning the repository and using git from the command line to open a pull request (see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/send-pr.html[Send Your Changes for Review]).

Further instructions relative to each supported language (Swift, Objective-C, C#, Java) can be found in each folder.
