Typically, an application needs to send data and receive data.
Directionality of the replication could be any of the following.

* *Push only:* The data is pushed from the local database to the remote database.
* *Pull only:* The data is pulled from the remote database to the local database.
* *Push and Pull:* The data is exchanged both ways.

Usually, the remote is a Sync Gateway database which is identified through a URL.
In the context of peer-to-peer syncing, the remote is another Couchbase Lite database.

The replication lifecycle is handled through the `MessageEndpointConnection`.

==== Active Peer

When Couchbase Lite calls back the application code through the `MessageEndpointConnection.send` method, you should send that data to the other peer using the communication framework.

Once the data is sent, call the completion block to acknowledge the completion.
You can use the `MessageError` in the completion block to specify if the error is recoverable or not.
If it is a recoverable error, the replicator will kick off a retry process which will result to creating a new `MessageEndpointConnection`.


When data is received from the passive peer via the Communication Framework, you call the `ReplicatorConnection.receive` method.

The replication connection's `receive` method is called which then processes the data in order to persist it to the local database.

==== Passive Peer

As in the case of the active peer, the passive peer must implement the `MessageEndpointConnection.send` method to send data to the other peer.
