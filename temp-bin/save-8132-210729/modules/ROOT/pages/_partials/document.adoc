In Couchbase Lite, a document's body takes the form of a JSON object -- a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be different types of data such as numbers, strings, arrays or even nested objects.
Every document is identified by a document ID, which can be automatically generated (as a UUID) or specified programmatically;
the only constraints are that it must be unique within the database, and it can't be changed.

=== Initializers

The following methods/initializers can be used:

* The `MutableDocument()` initializer can be used to create a new document where the document ID is randomly generated by the database.
* The `MutableDocument(withID: String)` initializer can be used to create a new document with a specific ID.
* The `database.getDocument(String id)` method can be used to get a document.
If it doesn't exist in the database, it will return `null`.
This method can be used to check if a document with a given ID already exists in the database.

The following code example creates a document and persists it to the database.
