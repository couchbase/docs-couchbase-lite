By default, Couchbase Lite gets all the channels to which the configured user account has access.
This behavior is suitable for most apps that rely on xref:sync-gateway::learn/authentication.adoc[user authentication] and the xref:sync-gateway::sync-function-api.adoc[sync function] to specify which data to pull for each user.

Optionally, it's also possible to specify a comma-separated list of channel names on Couchbase Lite's replicator configuration object.
In this case, the replication from Sync Gateway will only pull documents tagged with those channels.
