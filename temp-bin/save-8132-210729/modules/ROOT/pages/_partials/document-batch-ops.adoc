// Inclusion for use in {src-lang}-ref-api-doc files
If you're making multiple changes to a database at once, it's faster to group them together.
The following example persists a few documents in batch.

include::{snippet}[tag=batch,indent=0]

At the *local* level this operation is still transactional: no other `Database` instances, including ones managed by the replicator can make changes during the execution of the block, and other instances will not see partial changes.
But Couchbase Mobile is a distributed system, and due to the way replication works, there's no guarantee that Sync Gateway or other devices will receive your changes all at once.
